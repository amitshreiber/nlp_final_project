Coldplay,Viva La Diva,I could feel at the time. There was no way of knowing. Fallen leaves in the night. Who can say where they're blowing. As free as the wind. Hopefully learning. Why the sea on the tide. Has no way of turning. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. You know there's nothing. It was fun for a while. There was no way of knowing. Like a dream in the night. Who can say where we're going. No care in the world. Maybe I'm learning. Why the sea on the tide. Has no way of turning. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. There's nothing.,0
Madona,Like a Virgin,"Take me now, baby, here as I am. Hold me close, and try and understand. Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe. Love is a banquet on which we feed. Come on now, try and understand. The way I feel under your command. Take my hand, as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Cause the night belongs to us. Have I a doubt, baby, when I'm alone. Love is a ring a telephone. Love is an angel, disguised as lust. Here in our bed 'til the morning comes. Come on now, try and understand. The way I feel under your command. Take my hand, as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. With love we sleep,. with doubt the vicious circle turns, and burns. Without you, oh I cannot live,. forgive the yearning burning. I believe it's time to heal to feel,. so take me now, take me now, take me now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us",1
a,q,"These are. These are days you'll remember. Never before and never since, I promise. Will the whole world be warm as this. And as you feel it,. You'll know it's true. That you - you are blessed and lucky. It's true - that you. Are touched by something. That will grow and bloom in you. These are days you'll remember. When May is rushing over you. With desire to be part of the miracles. You see in every hour. You'll know it's true. That you are blessed and lucky. It's true that you are touched. By something that will grow and bloom in you. These are days. These are the days you might fill. With laughter until you break. These days you might feel. A shaft of light. Make its way across your face. And when you do. You'll know how it was meant to be. See the signs and know their meaning. You'll know how it was meant to be. Hear the signs and know they're speaking. To you, to you",2
b,r,"A lie to say, ""O my mountain has coal veins and beds to dig.. 500 men with axes and they all dig for me."" A lie to ssay, ""O my. river where mant fish do swim, half of the catch is mine when you haul. your nets in."" Never will he believe that his greed is a blinding. ray. No devil or redeemer will cheat him. He'll take his gold to. where he's lying cold.. A lie to say, ""O my mine gave a diamond as big as a fist."". But with every gem in his pocket, the jewels he has missed. A lie to. say, ""O my garden is growing taller by the day."" He only eats the. best and tosses the rest away. Never will he be believe that his. greed is a blinding ray. No devil or redeemer can cheat him. he'll. take his gold to where he's lying cold. Six deep in the grave.. Something is out of reach. something he wanted. something is out of reach. he's being taunted. something is out of reach. that he can' beg or steal nor can he buy. his oldest pain. and fear in life. there'll not be time. his oldest pain. and fear in life. there'll not be time. A lie to say ""O my forest has trees that block the sun and. when I cut them down I don't answer to anyone."" No, no, never will he. believe that his greed is a blinding ray no devil or redeemer can. cheat. him. He'll take his gold where he's lying cold..",3
c,s,"Trudging slowly over wet sand. Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen. This is a coastal town. That they forgot to close down. Armagedon - come armagedon come armagedon come. Everyday is like sunday. Everyday is silent and grey. Hide on a promanade. Etch on a post card:. How I dearly wish I was not here. In the seaside town. That they forgot to bomb. Come, come nuclear bomb!. Everyday is like sunday. Everyday is silent and grey. Trudging back over pebbles and sand. And a strange dust lands on your hands. (and on your face). Everyday is like sunday. Win yourself a cheap tray. Share some grease tea with me. Everyday is silent and grey",4
d,t,"Don't talk, I will listen. Don't talk, you keep your distance. For I'd rather hear some truth tonight. Than entertain your lies,. So take you poison silently. Let me be let me close my eyes. Don't talk, I'll believe it. Don't talk, listen to me instead,. I know that if you think of it,. Both long enough and hard. The drink you drown your troubles. In is the trouble you're in now. Talk talk talk about it,. If you talk as if you care. But when your talk is over. Tilt that bottle in the air,. Tossing back more than your share. Don't talk, I can guess it. Don't talk, well now your restless. And you need somewhere to put the blame. For how you feel inside. You'll look for a close. And easy mark and you'll see me as fair game. Talk talk talk about it,. Talk as if you care. But when your talk is over tilt. That bottle in the air. Tossing back more than your share. You talk talk talk about it,. You talk as if you care. I'm marking every word. And can tell this time for sure,. Your talk is the finest I have heard. So don't talk, I'll be sleeping,. Let me go on dreaming. How your eyes they glow so fiercely. I can tell your inspired. By the name you just chose for me. Now what was it?. O, never mind it. We will talk talk. Talk about this when your head is clear. I'll discuss this in the morning,. But until then you may talk but I won't hear",5
e,u,"Well they left then in the morning, a hundred pairs of wings. In the light moved together in the colors of the morning. I looked to the clouds in the cirrus sky and they'd gone.. Across the marshes, across the fields below.. I fell through the vines and I hoped they would catch me below.. If only to take me with them there,. Tell me the part that shinesIn your heart on the wind.. And the reeds blew in the morning.. Take me along to the places. You've gone when my eyes looked away.. Tell me the song that you sing in the trees in the dawning.. Tell me the part that shines in your heart. And the rays of love forever,. Please take me there..",6

g,w,"On bended kneeI've looked through every window then.. Touched the bottom, the night a sleepless day instead. A day when love came,came easy like what's lost now found.. Beneath a blinding light that would surround.. We were without, in doubt. We were about saving for a rainy day.. I crashed through mirrors,. I crashed through floors of laughter then.. In a blind scene, no ties would moor us to this room.. A day when love came, came easy like what's lost now found.. And you would save me, and I held you like you were my child.. If I were you, defiant you, alone upon a troubled way.. I would send my heart to you. To save it for a rainy day..",8
h,x,For whom do the bells toll. When sentenced to die. The stuttering rifles. Will stifle the cry. The monstrous anger. The fear's rapid rattle. A desert inferno. Kids dying like cattle. Don't tell me. We're not prepared. I've seen today's marine. He's eighteen and he's eager. He can be quite mean. No mock'ries for them. No prayers or bells. The demented choirs. The wailing of shells. The boys holding candles. On untraveled roads. The fear spreads like fire. As shrapnel explodes. I think it's wrong. To conscript our youth. Against their will. When plenty of our citizenry. Really like to kill. What sign posts will lead. To armageddon's fires. What bugles will call them. From crowded grey shires. The women sit quiet. With death on their minds. A slow dusk descending. The drawing of blinds. Make the hunters all line up. It's their idea of fun. And let those be forgiven. Who never owned a gun. Was it him or me. Or the wailing of the dead. The laughing soldiers. Cast their lots. And you can cut the dread.,9
i,y,"She walks alone on the brick lane,. the breeze is blowing.. A year had changed her forever,. just like her grey home.. He used to live so close here,. we'd look for places I can't remember.. The world was safe when she knew him,. she tried to hold him, hold on forever.. For all that never happens and all that never will be,. a candle burning for the love we seldom keep.. The earth was raw in her fingers,. she overturned it.. Considered planting some flowers,. they wouldn't last long,. no one to tend them.. It's funny how these things go,. you were the answer to all the questions.. The memories made her weary,. she shuddered slowly,. she didn't want to.. As a distant summer he began to whisper,. and threw a smile her way.. She looked into the glass,. liquid surface showing that they were melding,. together present past.. So where can I go from here?. The color fading,. he didn't answer.. She felt him slip from her vision.. She tried to hold him, hold on forever.. So close forever,. in a silent frozen sleep..",10
j,z,Jenny. Jenny you don't know the nights I hide. below a second story room. to whistle you down. the man who's let to divvy up. time is a miser. he's got a silver coin. only lets it shine for hours. while you sleep it away. there's one rare and odd style of living. part only known to the everybody Jenny. a comical where's the end parade. of the sort people here would think unusual. Jenny. tonight upon the mock brine of a Luna Sea. far off we sail on to Back O' The Moon. Jenny. Jenny you don't know the days I've tried. telling backyard tales. so to maybe amuse. o your mood is never giddy. if you smile I'm delighted. but you'd rather pout. such a lazy child. you dare fold your arms. tisk and say that I lie. there's one rare and odd style of thinking. part only known to the everybody Jenny. the small step and giant leap takers. got the head start in the race toward it. Jenny. tonight upon the mock brine of a Luna Sea. far off we sail on to the Back O' The Moon. that was a sigh. but not meant to envy you. when your age was mine. some things were sworn true. morning would come. and calendar pages had. new printed seasons on. their opposite sides. Jenny. Jenny you don't know the nights I hide. below a second story room. to whistle you down. o the man who's let to divvy up. time is a miser. he's got a silver coin. lets it shine for hours. while you sleep it away. there's one rare and odd style of living. part only known to the everybody Jenny. out of tin ships jump the bubble head boys. to push their flags into powdered soils and cry. no second placers. no smart looking geese in bonnets. dance with pigs in high button trousers. no milk pail for the farmer's daughter. no merry towns of sweet walled houses. here I've found. Back O' the Moon. not here. I've found. Back O' the Moon,11
k,aa,"You were looking away from me, western skies calling you.. Colors spilling, running dazzling you.. I was looking the other way, voices call from the east,. I saw my roots of the trees there planted at my feet.. It could be I'm searching for a place so small. with room for everything where worlds on worlds revolve.. But how can we wait?. I wouldn't hold you back.. suppose I was the clever one and words came easy to me.. I could say I was writing a song about you and me.. Maybe that verse is yet tobe found, but waits inside of me,. a secret room, a tangled web to unweave.. But how can we wait knowing our ways,. how can we hold on,. still you know it's not too late.",12
l,bb,"The color of the sky as far as I can see is coal grey.. Lift my head from the pillow and then fall again.. With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather.. A quiver in my lips as if I might cry.. Well by the force of will my lungs are filled and so I breathe.. Lately it seems this big bed is where I never leave.. Shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather.. Quiver in my voice as I cry,. ""What a cold and rainy day. Where on earth is the sun hid away."". I hear the sound of a noon bell chime. Now I'm far behind.. You've put in 'bout half a day while here I lie. with a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather.. A quiver in my lip as if I might cry,. ""What a cold and rainy day. Where on earth is the sun hid away?"". Do I need someone here to scold me. or do I need someone who'll grab and pull me out of this. four poster dull torpor pulling downward.. For it is such a long time since my better days.. I say my prayers nightly this will pass away.. The color of the sky is grey as I can see through the blinds.. Lift my head from the pillow and then fall again. with a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather.. A quiver in my voice as I cry,. ""What a cold and rainy day. Where on earth is the sun hid away?"". I shiver, quiver, and try to wake..",13
m,cc,"the legs of Maddox kitchen tables. my whole life twisted on a lathe. in a foreman's torrent. my first English was. ""faster boy if you want your pay"". barking commands. loud and simple. we could all obey. then I was forever pulling silvers. rubbed the sawdust always. deeper in my eye. varnish vapor that could linger. on my skin. it held tight. the whine of spinning blades. still echoes to bother my sleep at night. see that ox. stamped dead center. on the letter head of the company mail. four decades a spitting image. of the animal I portrayed. at Maddox Table a yoke was carved. for my neck. sun through the window oil spattered. and in mason jars. tricked plenty seeds thrive. the standing joke. around the shop was. with my green thumb. anything'd grow. my part was to laugh. show and ornery jig had. cut it at the knuckle bone. see that ox. trade mark burned. into every stick of furniture. from horn to tail. four decades a spitting image. of the animal I portrayed. at Maddox Table a yoke was carved. for my neck. was tailor made. o my Dolly was a weak. not a burdened girl. treat her to a piece of vaudville. a Wintergarden moving picture show. Bemus Point on July Sundays. by trolley we'd go. to your benefit we's strike or bargain. with the waving fist a union man. not just for. smokes spirits candy and cologne. but for. automobile keys. cash in the bank. and the deed. on a place called home",14
n,dd,Steep is the water tower. painted off blue to match the sky. can't ignore the train. night walks in the valley silent. you could swear the earth just moved. can't ignore the train. dust to be kicked up. in the crack faced. idle sinister town. screen door to the rail station. devil in her shoe. ran along side the wasted tracks. hem pins darted her calves. can't ignore the train. one spoiled girl with the tidiest apology. some how wedged inside her throat. can't ignore the train. patience their virtue. but I never could abide by that. dungeon life with electric light. a clean towel and a basin. mantle figures mind their place. laughs where they belong. through adventure we are not adventuresome. rage to share with a wardrobe mirror. in a room so beige and cold. can't ignore the train. window days saw the children pick their. street games on thirty afternoons. Molly the boys are. starting in the rhymic again. teasing more and more..... the second daughter. how she fell. young locked in Some Folk's Prison. made to dwell. til they're braiding. her grey hair. sitting in the wishing chair. sitting in the wishing chair. sitting in the wishing chair.,15
o,ff,"[original version by Lulu]. Those schoolgirl days of telling tales and biting nails are gone. But in my mind I know they will still live on and on. But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to. perfume?. It isn't easy but I'll try. If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky. In letters that would soar a thousand feet high. To Sir, With Love. The time has come for closing books and long last looks must end. And as I leave, I know that I am leaving my best friend. A friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong. That's a lot to learn - what can I give you in return?. If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start. But I would rather you let me give my heart. To Sir, With Love. Those awkward years have hurried by - why do they fly away?. Why is it, sir, that children grow up to be people one day?. What takes the place of climbing trees and dirty knees in the world. outside?. What is there for you I can buy?. If you wanted the world I'd surround it with a wall. I'd scrawl in words with letters ten feet tall. To Sir, With Love.",16
p,ee,"That summer fields grew high with foxglove stalks and ivy.. Wild apple blossoms everywhere.. Emerald green like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me.. There was no girl as warm as you.. How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need,. you'll never, you'll never know.. That summer fields grow high.. We made garland crowns in hiding, pulled stems of flowers from my hair.. Blue in the stream like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me.. There was no girl as bold as you.. How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need,. you'll never, you'll never know.. You'll never know.. Violet serene like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me.. There was no girl as warm as you.. How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need.. You'll never, you'll never know.. You'll never know.. That summer fields grow high.. We had wildflower fever. We had to lay down where they grow.. How I've learned to hide, how I've locked inside, you'd be surprised if shown.. But you'll never, you'll never know..",17
