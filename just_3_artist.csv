"10,000 Men","10,000 Men",Bob Dylan,"Ten thousand men on a hill
Ten thousand men on a hill
Some of ’m going’ down, some of ’m gonna get killed

Ten thousand men dressed in Oxford blue
Ten thousand men dressed in Oxford blue
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they’ll be coming for you

Ten thousand men on the move
Ten thousand men on the move
None of them doing nothin’ that your mama wouldn’t disapprove

Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold
All clean shaven, all coming in from the cold

Hey! Who could your lover be?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Let me eat off his head so you can really see!

Ten thousand women all dressed in white
Ten thousand women all dressed in white
Standing at my window wishing me Goodnight
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail
Each one of ’m got seven wives, each one of ’m just out of jail

Ten thousand women all sweepin’ my room
Ten thousand women all sweepin’ my room
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom

Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea!
Baby, thank you for my tea!
It’s so sweet of you to be so nice to me"
2 X 2,2 X 2,Bob Dylan,"One by one, they followed the sun
One by one, until there were none
Two by two, to their lovers they flew
Two by two, into the foggy dew
Three by three, they danced on the sea
Four by four, they danced on the shore
Five by five, they tried to survive
Six by six, they were playing with tricks

How many paths did they try and fail?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
How much poison did they inhale?
How many black cats crossed their trail?

Seven by seven, they headed for heaven
Eight by eight, they got to the gate
Nine by nine, they drank the wine
Ten by ten, they drank it again

How many tomorrows have they given away?
How many compared to yesterday?
How many more without any reward?
How many more can they afford?
Two by two, they stepped into the ark
Two by two, they step in the dark
Three by three, they’re turning the key
Four by four, they turn it some more

One by one, they follow the sun
Two by two, to another rendezvous"
32-20 Blues,32-20 Blues,Bob Dylan,"When I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure ain't gonna help her none
If she gets unruly, thinks she don't want you
If she gets unruly and thinks she don't want you
Take my 32-20 now and break her half in two
She got a .38 special, but I believe it's much too light
She got a .38 special, but I believe it's much too light
I got a 32-30, makes the camp all right

If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure ain't gonna help her none
Gonna shoot my pistol, shoot my Gatling gun
Gonna shoot my pistol, got to shoot my Gatling gun
You made me love you, now your man has come
Aw baby, where'd you stay last night?
Aw baby, where'd you stay last night?
You got your hair all tangled and you ain't talking right
Her .38 special, boys, it do very well
Her .38 special, boys, it do very well
I got a 32-20 now it's a burning hell

If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
All the doctors in, sure ain't gonna help her none
Hey hey baby, where'd you stay last night?
Hey hey baby, where'd you stay last night?
Didn't come home till the sun was shining bright
Oh boys, I just can't take my rest
Oh boys, I just can't take my rest
With this 32-20 laying up and down my breast"
4th Time Around,4th Time Around,Bob Dylan,"When she said
“Don’t waste your words, they’re just lies”
I cried she was deaf
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes
An' said, “What else you got left?”
Yeah, it was then that I got up to leave
But she said, “Don’t forget
Everybody must give something back
For something they get”
I stood there and hummed
I tapped on her drum I asked her ""How come?""
And she buttoned her boot
And straightened her suit
Then she said, “Don’t get cute”
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum
She threw me outside
I stood in the dirt where everyone walked
And after finding out I’d
Forgotten my shirt
I went back and knocked
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against
Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come, I asked her for some
She said, “No, dear”
I said, “Your words aren’t clear
You’d better spit out your gum”
She screamed 'til her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor
And I covered her up and then
Thought I’d go look through her drawer
And when I was through
I filled up my shoe
And brought it to you
And you, you took me in
You loved me then
You never wasted time
And I, I never took much
I never asked for your crutch
Now don’t ask for mine"
900 Miles from My Home,900 Miles from My Home,Bob Dylan,"But I'm down here on this track
Not a shirt upon my back
I will sell to you this island that I own
Yes I feed the mouths I took
But as down winds on the brook
Lord I'm 900 miles from my home
If my old lady she says so
I'll railroad no more
Sidetrack this engine but I still roam
Yes I've given in my call
I've gladly given it all
'Cause I'm 900 miles from my home
If I get down by the bank And the river still does run
Yes and everything I see turns to foam
Even down on the ocean side
No she don't wade in just to bang my pride
'Cause I'm 900 miles from my home
Oh Mary don't you moan
Don't you weep on the ground Oh Mary don't you weep and don't you moan
If I get myself in line
I will be there in due time
'Cause I'm 900 miles from my home"
A Fool Such as I,A Fool Such as I,Bob Dylan,"Now and then there's a fool such as I
Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you are gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I

Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you happened to be untrue
I am a fool but I love you, dear, yes I will until the day I die
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I

Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you are gone, when you are gone, I will dream a little
I will dream as years go by
Now and then, now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I

Now and then there's a fool, a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I am a fool, yes, but I love you dear, I will love you dear
Till the day, till the day I die
Now and then, now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I"
A Hard Rain’s  A-Gonna Fall [Gaslight 1962],A Hard Rain's  A-Gonna Fall [Gaslight 1962],Bob Dylan,"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young?one?
I’ve?stumbled on the?side of twelve misty mountains
I’ve walked?and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways
I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall


And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
I heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman, her body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall


And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what will you do now, my darling young one?
I’m a-going back out ’fore the rain starts a-falling
I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner’s face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I’ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But I’ll know my song well before I start singing

And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall"

A Satisfied Mind,A Satisfied Mind,Bob Dylan,"How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I'd do things my way
Hmm, but little they know
Hmm, it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind

Hmm, once I was wading in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life’s game
But suddenly it happened
Hmm, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out
My friends and my love ones
I'll leave there's no doubt
But one thing for certain
When it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind"
Abandoned Love,Abandoned Love (Ft. George Harrison),Bob Dylan,"I can see the turning of the key
I’ve been deceived by the clown inside of me
I thought that he was righteous but he’s vain
Oh, something’s a-telling me I wear the ball and chain

My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
He’s always off somewhere when I need him most
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is a-tellin’ me I love ya still

I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Won’t you let me in your room one time ’fore I finally disappear?

Everybody’s wearing a disguise
To hide what they’ve got left behind their eyes
But me, I can’t cover what I am
Wherever the children go I’ll follow them

I march in the parade of liberty
But as long as I love you I’m not free
How long must I suffer such abuse
Won’t you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?
I’ve given up the game, I’ve got to leave
The pot of gold is only make-believe
The treasure can’t be found by men who search
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church

We sat in an empty theater and we kissed
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list
My head tells me it’s time to make a change
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you’re strange

One more time at midnight, near the wall
Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl
Won’t you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it"
Absolutely Sweet Marie,Absolutely Sweet Marie,Bob Dylan,"Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can’t jump it
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see
I just sitting here beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

Well, I waited for you when I was half sick
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Yeah, when you knew I had some other place to be
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately

Well, six white horses that you did promise
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary
But to live outside the law, you must be honest
I know you always say that you agree
Alright so where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

Well, I don’t know how it happened
But the riverboat captain, he knows my fate
But everybody else, even yourself
They’re just gonna have to wait
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets
The Persian drunkard, he follows me
Yes, I can take him to your house but I can’t unlock it
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

Well, I been in jail when all the mail showed
That a man can’t give his address out to bad company
And now I stand here lookin’ at your yellow railroad
In the ruins of your balcony
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie"

Ain’t Gonna Grieve,Ain't Gonna Grieve,Bob Dylan,"Well, I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more
Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more
Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more
And ain’t a-gonna grieve no more

Come on brothers, join the band
Come on sisters, clap your hands
Tell everybody that’s in the land
You ain’t a-gonna grieve no more


Brown and blue and white and black
All one color on the one-way track
We got this far and ain’t a-goin’ back
And I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more


We’re gonna notify your next of kin
You’re gonna raise the roof until the house falls in
If you get knocked down get up again
We ain’t a-gonna grieve no more

We’ll sing this song all night long
Sing it to my baby from midnight on
She’ll sing it to you when I’m dead and gone
Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more"
Ain’t Talkin’,Ain't Talkin',Bob Dylan,"As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden
The wounded flowers were danglin' from the vine
I was passin' by yon cool and crystal fountain
Someone hit me from behind

Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Through this weary world of woe
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
No one on earth would ever know

They say prayer has the power to help
So pray from the mother
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
I'm a'tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others
But oh, mother, things ain't goin' well

Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
They'll be no mercy for ya' once you've lost

Now I'm all worn down by weepin'
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry
If I catch my opponents ever sleepin'
I'll just slaughter them where they lie
Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Through the world mysterious and vague
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Walkin' a'through the cities of the plague

Well, the whole world is filled with speculation
The whole wide world which people say is round
They will tear your mind away from contemplation
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down

Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Eatin' hog-eyed grease in a hog-eyed town
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Someday you'll be glad to have me around

They will crush you with wealth and power
Every wakin' moment you could crack
I'll make the most of one last extra hour
I'll avenge my father's death an' I'll step back

Ain't talkin', just walkin'
Hand me down my walkin' cane
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Got to get ya' out of my miserable brain
All o' my loyal and much-loved companions
They approve of me and share my code
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road

Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
My mule is sick, my horse is blind
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Thinkin' ‘bout that gal I left behind

Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'
Fame and honor never seem to fade
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin'
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?

Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Carryin' a dead man's shield
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
A'walkin' a'with a toothache in my heel

The sufferin' is unending
Every nook and cranny has its tears
I'm a'not playin', I'm not pretending
I'm not nursin' any superfluous fears
Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Walkin' ever since the other night
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Walkin' ‘til I'ma clean outta sight

As I walked out in the mystic garden
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn
""Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon
There's no one here, the gardener is gone""

Ain't talkin', a'just a'walkin'
Up the road around the bend
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
In the last outback, at the world's end"

All Along the Watchtower,All Along the Watchtower,Bob Dylan,"""There must be some way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth""

""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late""

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl"
All American Boy,All American Boy,Bob Dylan,"Well, I bought me a guitar, put it in tune
Went out there the month of June
'Twas a hot dog night and a stick in a roar
Everybody was a-down on this side
There was a holy cow (holy cow)
Mean cow (mean cow)
Double jaw (double jaw)
Cow (cow)
Well, I'll tell you a story about how to become
An all American boy, you can beat on a drum
Beat on a drum from five to six
You'll be rock 'n' rollin' soon gettin' your kicks
It's a good job (good job)
Join the band (gigging in the band)
Bring your hand (pick your hand)
Clean your hand and come up tight
Roll a smoke and down at night
Hold on a train, on a whiskey jar
Settle it down there you are
Hold it steady
Pick it up now
Now hit it (makin' the girls giggle)
Yes, you'll be makin' 'em little girlies giggle
You'll be makin' 'em all just jump up an' down an' wiggle
Empty their socks, in their britches
All you'll find that soon you'll be itches
Itches all over
Itch in your pants
Itch while you dance
Itchin' on down to the corn' of France
Well, I know a boy yesterday
He become a guitar and he floated away
He played his bars and he played 'em all
He's just on there havin' a ball
Kicking a hot storm up over the ocean
He took himself a notion
He got some lotion and
He put it on his guitar, put it on him
Next time you knew you can call him Jim
Down the road, boy, they call him Slim
They don't care if they're carry him
Just a minute now, you'll see what I mean
(Uncle Sam, in this land, rippin' up draft cards, an' all that)
Well, sooner or later a man's gonna come
He gonna take a look at you, look at your drum
He'd be a man and he'll take you home
Yeah, he'll take you out to his farm
He'll give you a good one
He'll give it to ya
(Well, you meet, girls don't giggle no more)
Well, sooner or later you're bound to meet his wife
And you'll come in 'n' have the time of your life
Just pickin' the gum, pickin' up a star
Pickin' up goin' and goin' to the bar
You and your manager (pickin' my nose)
Well, you'll want to know about the manager soon
He'll just take you outside and put you on the moon
He'll buy you new clothes, new pair of shoes
You'll be walk' away with the drummer blues
You'd be a fine drummer
Pick 'em as a comer
Dog hummer"

All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you
I don’t wanta' meet your kin

Or select you or dissect you
Or inspect you or reject you
All I really want to do

All Over You,All Over You,Bob Dylan,"Well, if I had to do it all over again
Babe, I’d do it all over you
And if I had to wait for ten thousand years
Babe, I’d even do that too
Well, a dog’s got his bone in the alley
A cat, she’s got nine lives
A millionaire’s got a million dollars
King Saud’s got four hundred wives
Well, ev’rybody’s got somethin’
That they’re looking’ forward to
I’m looking’ forward to when I can do it all again
And babe, I’ll do it all over you

Well, if I had my way tomorrow or today
Babe, I’d run circles all around
I’d jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin
I’d even dance a jig on the ground
Well, everybody gets their hour
Everybody gets their time
Little David when he picked up his pebbles
Even Sampson after he went blind
Well, everybody gets the chance
To do what they want to do
When my time arrives you better run for your life
’Cause babe, I’ll do it all over you
Well, I don’t need no money, I just need a day that’s sunny
Baby, and my days are gonna come
And I grab me a pint, you know that I’m a giant
When you hear me yelling’, “Fee-fi-fo-fum”
Well, you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle
You made me to a walk-in’ wreck
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone
Then you knocked off my head from my neck
Well, if I’m ever stand-in’ steady
A-doin’ what I want to do
Well, I tell you little lover that you better run for cover
’Cause babe, I’ll do it all over you

I’m just resting’ at your gate so that I won’t be late
And, momma, I’m a-just sitting’ on the shelf
Look out your window fair and you’ll see me squatting’ there
Just a-fumblin’ and a-mumbling’ to myself
Well, after my cigarette’s been smoked up
After all my liquor’s been drunk
After my dreams are dreamed out
After all my thoughts have been thunk
Well, after I do some of these things
I’m gonna do what I have to do
And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide
’Cause babe, I’ll do it all over you"
All or Nothing at All,All or Nothing at All,Bob Dylan,"All or nothing at all
Half a love never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all
All or nothing at all
If it's love there is no in-between
Why begin then cry for something that might have been
No I'd rather have nothing at all
Please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile, I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes and the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall
And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be caught in the undertow
And so you see, I've got to say ""No, no""
All or nothing at all
All or nothing at all"

All the Way,All the Way,Bob Dylan,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you all the way
Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real
When somebody needs you
It's no good unless she needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all those in-between years come what may
Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way
And when somebody needs you

Angelina,Angelina,Bob Dylan,"Well, it’s always been my nature to take chances
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances
To the tune of a concertina

Blood dryin’ in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door
But whatever it could be, makes me think you’ve seen me before
Angelina

Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina

His eyes were two slits that would make a snake proud
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed
And the head of a hyena

Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek
Angelina

In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode
The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road
With your subpoena

When you cease to exist, then who will you blame
I’ve tried my best to love you but I cannot play this game
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same
Angelina


There’s a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone
Your servants are half dead, you’re down to the bone
Tell me, tall men, where would you like to be overthrown
Maybe down in Jerusalem or Argentina?

She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold
He’s surrounded by God’s angels and she’s wearing’ a blindfold
And so are you, Angelina

I see pieces of men marching; trying to take heaven by force
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse
In God’s truth tell me what you want and you’ll have it of course
Just step into the arena

Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases
Pass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces
Begging God for mercy and weeping’ in unholy places
Angelina"

Are You Ready,Are You Ready,Bob Dylan,"Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready?

Are you ready to meet Jesus?
Are you where you ought to be?
Will He know you when He sees you
Or will He say, “Depart from Me”?

Are you ready, hope you’re ready
Am I ready, am I ready?
Am I ready, am I ready?

Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren
And to take up my cross?
Have I surrendered to the will of God
Or am I still acting like the boss?

Am I ready, hope I’m ready

When destruction cometh swiftly
And there’s no time to say a fare-thee-well
Have you decided whether you want to be
In heaven or in hell?
Are you ready, are you ready?

Have you got some unfinished business?
Is there something holding you back?
Are you thinking for yourself
Or are you following the pack?

Are you ready, hope you’re ready
Are you ready?
Are you ready for the judgment?
Are you ready for that terrible swift sword?
Are you ready for Armageddon?
Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Are you ready, I hope you’re ready"
Arthur McBride,Arthur McBride,Bob Dylan,"Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
As we went a-walking down by the seaside
Mark now what followed and what did betide
For it being on Christmas morning
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
And a little wee drummer intending to camp
For the day being pleasant and charming

""Good morning, good morning,"" the Sergeant he cried
""And the same to you, gentlemen,"" we did reply
Intending no harm but meant to pass by
For it being on Christmas morning
""But,"" says he, ""My fine fellows, if you will enlist
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick to your fist
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust
And drink the king's health in the morning

""For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife
And he always lives pleasant and charming
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean
And sup on thin gruel in the morning.""
""But,"" says Arthur, ""I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose
But you dare not change them one night, for you know
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning
And although that we're single and free
We take great delight in our own company
We have no desire strange places to see
Although that your offers are charming

""And we have no desire to take your advance
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France
Where we would get shot without warning,""
""Oh no,"" says the Sergeant. ""I'll have no such chat
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats
For if you insult me with one other word
I'll cut off your heads in the morning.""

And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head
And bid them take that as fair warning
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides
We flung them as far as we could in the tide
""Now take them up, devils!"" cried Arthur McBride
""And temper their edge in the morning!""
And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll
And bade it a tedious returning
And we having no money, paid them off in cracks
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks
And left them for dead in the morning

And so, to conclude and to finish disputes
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
And bid them look sharp in the morning'

Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
As we went a-walking down by the seaside
Mark now what followed and what did betide
For it being on Christmas morning"
As I Went Out One Morning,As I Went Out One Morning,Bob Dylan,"As I went out one morning
To breathe the air around Tom Paine’s
I spied the fairest damsel
That ever did walk in chains
I offered her my hand
She took me by the arm
I knew that very instant
She meant to do me harm

“Depart from me this moment”
I told her with my voice
Said she, “But I don’t wish to”
Said I, “But you have no choice”
“I beg you, sir,” she pleaded
From the corners of her mouth
“I will secretly accept you
And together we’ll fly south”

Just then Tom Paine, himself
Came running from across the field
Shouting at this lovely girl
And commanding her to yield
And as she was letting go her grip
Up Tom Paine did run
“I’m sorry, sir,” he said to me
“I’m sorry for what she’s done”"
As Time Goes By,As Time Goes By,Bob Dylan,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is still just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by"

Drift by the window
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold

And soon I'll hear
Old winter's song
But I miss you most of all
My darling
When autumn leaves
Start to fall"

Make a poor man wonder where he wanna go

About five miles 'cross the pond
They rowed a little boat
About five miles 'cross the pond
I packed up all of my things and threw 'em in
Boys and the boat rowed along
I climbed up on the high lonely hill
Oh, I climbed up on the high oh, lonely hill
And I looked down at the house

Backwater blues caused me
To pack my things and go

To pack my things and go

Ballad for a Friend,Ballad for a Friend,Bob Dylan,"Sad I’m a-sittin’ on the railroad track
Watching’ that old smokestack
Train is a-leavin’ but it won’t be back

Years ago we hang around
Watching’ trains roll through the town
Now that train is a-graveyard bound

Where we go up in that North Country
Lakes and streams and mines so free
I had no better friend than he

Something happened to him that day
I thought I heard a stranger say
I hung my head and stole away

A diesel truck was headin’ down
Carryin' up a heavy load
Left him on a Utah road

They carried him back to his hometown
His mother cried, his sister moaned
Listening’ to them church bells tone
A diesel truck was rollin' slow
Pullin' down a heavy load
It left him on a Utah road
I-I sung the last verse for ya because I missed the words the first time I sung them about the truck"
Ballad in Plain D,Ballad in Plain D,Bob Dylan,"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn
I courted her proudly but now she is gone
Gone as the season she's taken

In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us

Of the two sisters, I loved the young
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one
Their constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone
By the jealousy of others around her

For her parasite sister, I had no respect
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
As a crutch for her scenes and her society

Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused
The changes I was going through can't even be used
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime
With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
To the sin of love's false security

From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
Answers of emptiness voice vacancies
'Til the tombstones of damage read no questions but please
What's wrong, what's exactly the matter?

And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen
Tumbled all down into pieces

""The tragic figure"" her sister did shout
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out""
And I in my armor, turning about
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness

Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground
And she in between, the victim of sound
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me

The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Will be fully aware of how precious she is

Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me
""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""
And I answer them most mysteriously
""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?"""
Ballad of Donald White,Ballad of Donald White,Bob Dylan,"My name is Donald White, you see
I stand before you all
I was judged by you a murderer
And the hangman's knot must fall
I will die upon the gallows pole
When the moon is shining clear
And these are my final words
That you will ever hear
I left my home in Kansas
When I was very young
I landed in the old Northwest
Seattle, Washington
Although I'd a-traveled many miles
I never made a friend
For I could never get along in life
With people that I met
If I had some education
To give me a decent start
I might have been a doctor or
A master in the arts
But I used my hands for stealing
When I was very young
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells
That's how my life begun
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners
I found they were my kind
And it was there inside the bars
I found my peace of mind
But the jails they were too crowded
Institutions overflowed
So they turned me loose to walk upon
Life's hurried tangled road
And there's danger on the ocean
Where the salt sea waves split high
And there's danger on the battlefield
Where the shells of bullets fly
And there's danger in this open world
Where men strive to be free
And for me the greatest danger
Was in society
So I asked them to send me back
To the institution home
But they said they were too crowded
For me they had no room
I got down on my knees and begged
""Oh, please put me away,""
But they would not listen to my plea
Or nothing I would say
And so it was on Christmas eve
In the year of '59
It was on that night I killed a man
I did not try to hide
The jury found me guilty
And I won't disagree
For I knew that it would happen
If I wasn't put away
And I'm glad I've had no parents
To care for me or cry
For now they will never know
The horrible death I die
And I'm also glad I've had no friends
To see me in disgrace
For they'll never see that hangman's hood
Wrap around my face
Farewell unto the old north woods
Of which I used to roam
Farewell unto the crowded bars
Of which've been my home
Farewell to all you people
Who think the worst of me
I guess you'll feel much better when
I'm on that hanging tree
But there's just one question
Before they kill me dead
I'm wondering just how much
To you I really said
Concerning all the boys that come
Down a road like me
Are they enemies or victims
Of your society?"
Ballad of Hollis Brown,Ballad of Hollis Brown,Bob Dylan,"Hollis Brown

Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That’s hanging on the wall
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can’t seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can’t seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you’re holding in your hand

There’s seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
There’s seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean’s poundin' roar

There’s seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
There’s seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewheres in the distance
There’s seven new people born"
Ballad of a Thin Man,Ballad of a Thin Man,Bob Dylan,"You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you, you say, ""Who is that man?""
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you will say
When you get home

Because something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You raise up your head
And you ask ""Is this where it is?""
And somebody points to you and says
""It's his""
And you say ""What's mine?""
And somebody else says ""Well, what is?""
And you say, ""Oh my God, am I here all alone?""

But something is happening
And ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says ""How does it feel to
Be such a freak?""
And you say, ""Impossible""
As he hands you a bone

And something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To all give a check
To tax-deductible charity organization
Aw, you've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You are very well read
It's well known
But something is happening here
And ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, ""Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan""

And you know something is happening
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones?

Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word ""Now""
And you say, ""For what reason?""
And he says, ""How?""
And you say, ""What does this mean?""
And he screams back ""You're a cow
Give me some milk or else go home""
And you know something's happening
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones?

Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There oughtta be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones

'Cause something is happening
And ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones?"
Ballad of the Gliding Swan,Ballad of the Gliding Swan,Bob Dylan,"Tenderly william kissed his wife
Then he opened her head with a butcher knife
And the swan on the river goes gliding by
The swan on the river goes gliding by
Lady margaret's pillow was wet with tears
Nobody's been on it for 20 years
And the swan on the river goes gliding by
The swan on the river goes gliding by
Little billy brown will shake with fright
He's got a new daddy and mommy every night
And the swan on the river goes gliding by
The swan on the river goes gliding by
""i've got a sad surprise"" the doctor said
""a 20 pound baby without any head""
And the swan on the river went lookin'....."

Barbara Allen,Barbara Allen,Bob Dylan,"'Twas in the merry month of May
When green buds all were swelling
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For love of Barbara Allen
He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Saying you must come, to my master dear
If your name be Barbara Allen
So slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she drew nigh him
And the only words to him did say
""Young man, I think you're dying""
He turned his face unto the wall
And death was in him welling
Goodbye, goodbye, to my friends all
Be good to Barbara Allen
When he was dead and laid in grave
She heard the death bells knelling
And every stroke to her did say
Hard-hearted Barbara Allen
Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow
Sweet William died of love for me
And I will die of sorrow
And father, oh father, go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow
Sweet William died on yesterday
And I will die tomorrow
Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard
Sweet William was buried beside her
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar
They grew and grew in the old churchyard
Till they could grow no higher
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot
And the rose grew round the briar"
Belle Isle,Belle Isle,Bob Dylan,"One evening for pleasure I rambled to view
The fair fields all alone
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron
Where beauty and pleasure were known

I spied a fair maid at her labour
Which caused me to stay for a while
And I thought of a goddess to beauty
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle

I humbled myself to her beauty
""Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Are you from heaven descended
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne?""

""Young man, I will tell you a secret
It's true I'm a maid that is poor
And to part from my vows and my promise
Is more than my heart can endure

Therefore I remain at my service
And go through all my hardship and toil
And wait for the lad that has left me
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle.""
""Young maiden I wish not to banter
It's true I come here in disguise
I came here to fulfill our last promise
And hope to give you a surprise

I've known you're a maid I love dearly
And you've been in my heart all the while
For me there is no other damsel
Than my blooming bright star of Belle Isle."""
Bells of Rhymney,Bells of Rhymney,Bob Dylan,"Oh what will you give me?

Is there hope for the future?

And who robbed the miner?

They will plunder willy-nilly
Say the bells of Caerphilly
They have fangs, they have teeth
Shout the loud bells of Neath
Even God is uneasy
Say the moist bells of Swansea
And what will you give me?

Throw the vandals in court
Say the bells of Newport
All would be well, if, if, if, if

Beyond Here Lies Nothin’,Beyond Here Lies Nothin',Bob Dylan,"Oh, well, I love ya pretty baby
You're the only love I've ever known
Just as long as you stay with me
The whole world is my throne

Beyond here lies nothin
Nothin we can call our own

Well, I'm moving after midnight
Down boulevards of broken cars
Don't know what I'd do without it
Without this love that we call ours

Beyond here lies nothin
Nothin but the moon and stars

Down every street there's a window
And every window made of glass
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby
For as long as love will last
Beyond here lies nothin
But the mountains of the past

Well, my ship is in the harbor
And the sails are spread
Listen to me, pretty baby
Lay your hand upon my head

Beyond here lies nothin
Nothin done, and nothin said"
Beyond the Horizon,Beyond the Horizon,Bob Dylan,"Beyond the horizon, behind the sun
At the end of the rainbow life has only begun
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love

My wretched heart's pounding
I felt an angel's kiss
My memories are drowning
In mortal bliss
Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall
Love waits forever for one and for all

Beyond the horizon across the divide
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side
Down in the valley the water runs cold
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul

I'm touched with desire
What don't I do?
I'll throw the logs on the fire
I'll build my world around you
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same

Beyond the horizon the night winds blow
The theme of a melody from many moons ago
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time

It's dark and it's dreary
I ponder in vain
I'm weakened, I'm weary
My repentance is plain
Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me

Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone

It's late in the season
Never knew, never cared
Whatever the reason
Someone's life has been spared
Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you"
Big River,Big River (Ft. Johnny Cash),Bob Dylan,"Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die
I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called
Then you took me to St. Louis later on, down the river
A freighter said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the bluff
She raised a few eyebrows and went on down alone
Now, won't you paddle down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, rollin' on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf
She loves you, Big River, more than me
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die"
Big Yellow Taxi,Big Yellow Taxi,Bob Dylan,"They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
A pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot

They took all the trees, they put them in a tree museum
They charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot

Hey farmer, farmer, put away that D.D.T
Give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees, please
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot

Late last night I heard my screen door slam
A big yellow bulldozer took away my house and land
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot"

Into her dark hallway she will lead ya
In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya

To be shot down by the man who was your friend?

Black Cross,Black Cross,Bob Dylan,"This is the story of Hezekiah Jones
Hezekiah Jones lived in a place... in Arkansas
He never had too much, except he had some land
An' he had a couple of hogs and things like that
He never had much money
But he'd spend what he did make as fast as he made it
So it never really mattered that he had much money
But in a cupboard there, he kept in the cupboard...
He kept in the cupboard books
He called the books his ""rainy season.""
The white folks around the county there talked about Hezekiah...
They... said, ""Well... old Hezekiah, he's harmless enough
But the way I see it he better put down them goddam books
Readin' ain't no good, for nigga is nigga.""
One day the white man's preacher came around
Knockin' on doors, knockin' on all the doors in the county
He knocked on Hezekiah's door
He says, ""Hezekiah, you believe in the Lord?""
Hezekiah says, ""Well, I don't know, I never really SEEN the Lord
I can't say, yes, I do...""
He says, ""Hezekiah, you believe in the Church?""
Hezekiah says, ""Well, the Church is divided, ain't they
And... they can't make up their minds
I'm just like them, I can't make up mine either.""
He says, ""Hezekiah, you believe that if a man is good Heaven is his last reward?""
Hezekiah says, ""I'm good... good as my neighbor.""
""You don't believe in nothin',"" said the white man's preacher
You don't believe in nothin'!""
""Oh yes, I do,"" says Hezekiah
""I believe that a man should be indebted to his neighbors
Not for the reward of a Heaven or fear of hellfire.""
""But you don't understand,"" said the white man's preacher
""There's a lot of good ways for a man to be wicked...""
Then they hung Hezekiah high as a pigeon
White folks around there said, ""Well... he had it comin'
'Cause the son-of-a-bitch never had no religion!"""
Black Crow Blues,Black Crow Blues,Bob Dylan,"I woke in the mornin', wandering
Weary and worn out
I woke in the morning’, wandering
Weary and worn out
Wishin’ my long-lost lover
Would walk to me, and talk to me
Tell me what it’s all about

I was standin’ at the side road
Listenin’ to the billboard knock
Standin' at the side road
Listenin’ to the billboard knock
Well, my wrist was empty
But my nerves were kickin’
Tickin’ like a clock

Well I got anything you need, babe
Let me tell you in front
If I got anything you need, babe
Let me tell you in front
You can come to me sometime
Night time, day time
Any time you want
Sometimes I’m thinkin' I’m
Too high to fall
Sometimes I’m thinkin' I’m
Much too high to fall
Other times I’m thinkin' I’m
So low I don’t know
If I can come up at all

Sleepin' across a broad highway
Black crows in the meadow
Across a broad highway
Though it’s funny, honey
I'm outta' touch, don’t feel much like a

Black Diamond Bay,Black Diamond Bay,Bob Dylan,"Up on the white veranda
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat
Her passport shows a face
From another time and place
She looks nothing like that
And all the remnants of her recent past
Are scattered in the wild wind
She walks across the marble floor
Where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in
She smiles, walks the other way
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
From Black Diamond Bay

As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write
“Pardon, monsieur,” the desk clerk says
Carefully removes his fez
“Am I hearing you right?”
And as the yellow fog is lifting
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor
She passes him on the spiral staircase
Thinking he’s the Soviet Ambassador
She starts to speak, but he walks away
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
On Black Diamond Bay
A soldier sits beneath the fan
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout
“Can you see anything?”
Then the Greek appears on the second floor
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle
Says, “Open up another deck”
But the dealer says, “Attendez-vous, s’il vous plait”
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
From Black Diamond Bay

The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough
He tried to grab the woman’s hand
Said, “Here’s a ring, it cost a grand”
She said, “That ain't enough”
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb
She passed the door that the Greek had locked
Where a handwritten sign read, “Do Not Disturb”
She knocked upon it anyway
As the sun went down and the music did play
On Black Diamond Bay
“I’ve got to talk to someone quick!”
But the Greek said, “Go away,” and he kicked the chair to the floor
He hung there from the chandelier
She cried, “Help, there’s danger near
Please open up the door!”
Then the volcano erupted
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
Thinking of forbidden love
But the desk clerk said, “It happens every day”
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
On Black Diamond Bay

As the island slowly sank
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room
The dealer said, “It’s too late now
You can take your money, but I don’t know how
You’ll spend it in the tomb”
The tiny man bit the soldier’s ear
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew
While she’s out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her
“My darling, je vous aime beaucoup”
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
From Black Diamond Bay
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A
Watching old Cronkite on the seven o’clock news
It seems there was an earthquake that
Left nothing but a Panama hat
And a pair of old Greek shoes
Didn’t seem like much was happening
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer
Seems like every time you turn around
There’s another hard-luck story that you’re going to hear
And there’s really nothing anyone can say
And I never did plan to go anyway
To Black Diamond Bay"
Black Rider,Black Rider,Bob Dylan,"Black rider, black rider, you've been living too hard
Been up all night, have to stay?on?your guard
The path?that you're walking, too narrow to?walk
Every step of the way, another stumbling block
The road that?you're?on,?same road that?you know
Just not?the same as it was a minute ago

Black rider, black rider, you've seen it all
You've seen the great world and you've seen the small
You fell into the fire and you're eating the flame
Better seal up your lips if you wanna stay in the game
Be reasonable, mister, be honest, be fair
Let all of your earthly thoughts be a prayer

Black rider, black rider, all dressed in black
I'm walking away, you try to make me look back
My heart is at rest, I'd like to keep it that way
I don't wanna fight, at least not today
Go home to your wife, stop visiting mine
One of these days I'll forget to be kind

Black rider, black rider, tell me when, tell me how
If there ever was a time, then let it be now
Let me go through, open the door
My soul is distressed, my mind is at war
Don't hug me, don't flatter me, don't turn on the charm
I'll take a sword and hack off your arm
Black rider, black rider, hold it right there
The size of your cock will get you nowhere
I'll suffer in silence, I'll not make a sound
Maybe I'll take the high moral ground
Some enchanted evening I'll sing you a song
Black rider, black rider, you've been on the job too long"

She answered to him with a lovin' smile
""I'll be sixteen come Sunday

""Come and go with me, my pretty little miss

Made of Spanish leather
Got behind him on his horse
And they rode off together
They rode off together

At night the boss came home
Inquiring about this lady
The servant spoke before she thought
""She's been with Black Jack Dave
Rode off with Black Jack Davey.""

""Well, saddle for me my coal black stud
He's speedier than the gray
I rode all day and I'll ride all night
And I'll overtake my lady
I'll bring back my lady.""

Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight
Till he came to a river raging
And there he spied his darling bride
In the arms of Black Jack Davey
Wrapped up with Black Jack Davey

""Would you forsake your house and home
Would you forsake your baby?
Would you forsake your husband, too
To go with Black Jack Davey
Rode off with Black Jack Davey?""

And I'll forsake my baby
I'll forsake my husband, too

Between my husband and baby
Tonight I lay on the river banks
In the arms of Black Jack Davey
Love my Black Jack Davey."""
Blind Willie McTell,Blind Willie McTell,Bob Dylan,"Seen the arrow on the doorpost
Saying, “This land is condemned
All the way from New Orleans
To Jerusalem”
I traveled through East Texas
Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

Well, I heard that hoot owl singing
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Was his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
See the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes moaning
Hear that undertaker’s bell
Nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
There’s a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
He’s dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
There’s a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

Well, God is in His heaven
And we all want what’s His
But power and greed and corruptible seed
Seem to be all that there is

Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you, babe
I don't care what in the world you do

She looked at me, begin to smile
Said, ""Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?""
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Got blood in my eyes for you, babe
I don't care what in the world you do

No, no, mama, I can't wait
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you, babe
I don't care what in the world you do
I tell you something, tell you the facts
You don't want me, give my money back
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you, babe
I don't care what in the world you do"

Blue Moon,Blue Moon,Bob Dylan,"Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own

Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for someone I really could care for

And suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold
I heard someone whisper, ""Please, adore me""
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Without a love of my own"

Bob Dylan’s 115th Dream,Bob Dylan's 115th Dream,Bob Dylan,"I was riding on the Mayflower
When I thought I spied some land
I yelled for Captain Arab
I have you understand
Who came running to the deck
Said, ""Boys, forget the whale
Look on over yonder
Cut the engines
Change the sail
Haul on the bowline""
We sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do
When they're far away at sea
""I think I'll call it America""
I said as we hit land
I took a deep breath
I fell down, I could not stand
Captain Arab he started
Writing up some deeds
He said, ""Let's set up a fort
And start buyin' a place with beads""
Just then this cop comes down the street
Crazy as a loon
He throws us all in jail
For carrying harpoons
Ah, me I busted out
Don't even ask me how
I went to get some help
I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down
To the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around
Sayin', ""Ban the bums""
I jumped right into line
Sayin' ""I hope that I'm not late""
When I realized I hadn't eaten
For five days straight
I went into a restaurant
Looking for the cook
I told him I was the editor
Of a famous etiquette book
The waitress he was handsome
He wore a powder blue cape
I ordered some Suzette, I said
""Could you please make that Crepe?""
Just then the whole kitchen exploded
From boilin' fat
Food was flyin' everywhere
I left without my hat
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy
But I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab
And all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral
And I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley
When up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house
I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out
And robbed my boots
And I was on the street again
Well, I rapped upon a house
With the US flag upon display
I said, ""Could you help me out
I got some friends down the way""
""The man says, ""Get out of here
I'll tear you limb from limb""
I said, ""You know they refused Jesus, too""
He said, ""You're not Him
Get out of here before I break your bones
I ain't your pop""
I decided to have him arrested
And I went lookin' for a cop
I ran right outside
I hopped inside a cab
I went out the other door
This Englishman said, ""Fab""
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand
And a chariot that stood
Parked across from a building
Advertising brotherhood
I ran right through the front door
Like a hobo sailor does
But it was just a funeral parlor
And the man asked me who I was
I repeated that my friends
Were all in jail, with a sigh
He gave me his card
He said, ""Call me if they die""
I shook his hand and said goodbye
Ran out to the street
When a bowling ball came down the road
And knocked me off my feet
A pay phone was ringing
And it just about blew my mind
When I picked it up and said hello
This foot came through the line
Well, by this time I's fed up
At tryin' to make a stab
At bringing back any help
For my friends and captain Arab
I decided to flip a coin
Like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go
Back to ship or back to jail
So I hocked my sailor suit
And I got a coin to flip
It came up tails
It rhymed with sails
So I made it back to the ship
Well, I got back and took
The parking ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds
When this coastguard boat went past
They asked me my name
And I said, ""Captain Kidd""
They believed me but
They wanted to know
What exactly that I did
I said for the Pope of Eruke
I was employed
They let me go right away
They were very paranoid
Well, the last I heard of Arab
He was stuck on a whale
That was married to the deputy
Sheriff of the jail
But the funniest thing was
When I was leavin' the bay
I saw three ships sailin'
There were all heading my way
I asked the captain what his name was
And how come he didn't drive a truck
He said his name was Columbus
I just said, ""Good luck"""
Bob Dylan’s Blues,Bob Dylan's Blues,Bob Dylan,"Unlike most of the songs nowadays that have been written up in Tin Pan Alley, that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this, this is a song, this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States

Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto
They are riding down the line
Fixing everybody’s troubles
Everybody’s except mine
Somebody must have told them
That I was doing fine

Oh you five and ten cent women
With nothing in your heads
I got a real gal I’m loving
And Lord I’ll love her till I’m dead
Go away from my door and my window too
Right now

Lord, I am not going down to no race track
See no sports car run
I don’t have no sports car
And I don’t even care to have one
I can walk anytime around the block
Well, the wind keeps a-blowing me
Up and down the street
With my hat in my hand
And my boots on my feet
Watch out so you don’t step on me

Well, look it here buddy
You want to be like me
Pull out your six-shooter
And rob every bank you can see
Tell the judge I said it was all right
Yes!"
Bob Dylan’s Dream,Bob Dylan's Dream,Bob Dylan,"While riding on a train going west
I fell asleep for to take my rest
I dreamed a dream that made me sad
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had

With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon
Where we together weathered many a storm
Laughin and singin till the early hours of the morn

By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung
Our words was told, our songs was sung
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied
Jokin' and talkin' about the world outside

With hungry hearts through the heat and cold
We never much thought we could get very old
We thought we could sit forever in fun
And our chances really was a million to one

As easy it was to tell black from white
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right
And our choices, they were few so the thought never hit
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split

How many a year has passed and gone
Many a gamble has been lost and won
And many a road taken by many a first friend
And each one I’ve never seen again


I wish, I wish, I wish in vain
That we could sit simply in that room again
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat
And I’d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that"
Bob Dylan’s New Orleans Rag,Bob Dylan's New Orleans Rag,Bob Dylan,"I was sittin' on a stump down in New Orleans
I was feelin' kinda low down, dirty an' mean
Along come a fella and he didn't even ask
He said, ""I know of a woman who can fix you up fast.""
Well I didn't think twice, I just said like I should
""Let's go find this lady who can do me some good.""
We walked across Rampart on a sailin' spree
And we come to a door called one-oh-three
I's just about ready to give my little knock
When out comes a fella who couldn't even walk
He's linkin' and a-slinkin', couldn't stand on his feet
And he moaned and he groaned and he shuffled down the street
Well, out of the door there comes another man
He couldn't even talk and he couldn't even stand
He moaned and he groaned and he shuffled his feet
And he slid slidin' backwards down on Rampart street
Well, I peeked thru the key hole and comin' down the hall
Was a long legged man who could hardly crawl
He had a terrible mean look in his eye
Like he'd just fall to burn, he's was ready to die
Well somebody else with his hell of a miss
Fell out of the window and he fell the test
Well he slid and he slunk in broken french
And he looked like he'd been thru a monkey wrench
Well, by this time I was a-scared to knock
I was a-scared to move, I's in a state of shock
I hummed a little tune and I shuffled my feet
And I started walkin' backwards down Rampart street
Well, I got to the corner I tried my best smile
I turned around the corner and I ran a bloody mile
Man, I wasn't around for to meet my wife
I's just a-runnin' for to save my life
Well, I's coughin' in my ears and wheezin' in my chest
I musta run a mile in a minute or less
I tripped on a log and I flumped on a stump
I caught a fast freight train with a one-arm jump
So if you're travellin' down Louisiana way
And you're feelin' kinda lonesome and you need a place to stay
Man, you're better off in your misery
Than to tackle that lady in one-oh-three"
Bonnie Ship the Diamond,Bonnie Ship the Diamond,Bob Dylan,"Well, the bonnie ship was a good old ship
She was a-fishin' on a leading chain
And me an' John, oh was a long catch on
It was the last of the ones I've seen
So with a sword and a rope in belt
Feel all that your heart be sailed
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales
Well, we feud all night, the cabin gauge
It was a-more than feelin' bad
And with all kind friends we watched in fear
It was a naught time we ever had
So it's rise up my lads
Let your hearts never fail
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales
And all day long at Vera Cruz
We sailed  to bind
With no heavy moan, any hearts of stone
No aid was tried for mine
So it's cheer up my boys
Let your hearts never fail
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales
Well, now along cape Fate, 'twas lit in red
All along cape Horn
And from Vera Cruz we sailed ahead
It was all in the time of storm
So, it's cheer on up my boys
Let your hearts never fail
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales"

Boots of Spanish Leather,Boots of Spanish Leather,Bob Dylan,"Oh, I’m sailin' away my own true love
I’m a-sailin' away in the morning
Is there somethin' I can send you from across the sea
From the place that I’ll be landing?
No, there’s nothin' you can send me, my own true love
There’s nothin' I'm a-wishing to be ownin'
Just a-carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean
Ah, but I just thought you might want somethin' fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona
Well, if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I’d forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that’s all I’m a-wishin' to be ownin'
Well I might be gone a long old time
And it’s only that I’m asking
Is there somethin' I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passing
Oh, how can, how can you ask me again
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I would want today
I want again tomorrow
I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Sayin' I don’t know when I’ll be comin' back again
It depends on how I’m a-feelin'
If a-you, my love, must think that-a-way
I’m sure your mind is a-roamin'
I’m sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you’re goin'
So take heed, take heed of the western winds
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes, there’s somethin' you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather"
Born in Time,Born in Time,Bob Dylan,"In the lonely night
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
You’re coming’ thru to me in black and white
When we were made of dreams

You’re blowing down the shaky street
You’re hearing my heart beat
In the record-breaking heat
Where we were born in time

Not one more night, not one more kiss
Not this time baby, no more of this
Takes too much skill, takes too much will
It’s revealing

You came, you saw, just like the law
You married young, just like your ma
You tried and tried, you made me slide
You left me reeling with this feeling

On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
You won’t get anything you don’t deserve
Where we were born in time
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice
You hang the flame, you’ll pay the price
Oh babe, that fire

Is still smoking
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, you were plain
Oh babe, truer words
Have not been spoken or broken

In the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You can have what’s left of me
Where we were born in time"

Brownsville Girl,Brownsville Girl,Bob Dylan,"Well, there was this movie I seen one time
About a man riding ’cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck

Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath
“Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square
I want him to feel what it’s like to every moment face his death”

Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain
You know I can’t believe we’ve lived so long and are still so far apart
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train

I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
Ah, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel

Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton’
And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back
I would have gone on after you but I didn’t feel like letting my head get blown off
Well, we’re driving’ this car and the sun is coming’ up over the Rockies
Now I know she ain’t you but she’s here and she’s got that dark rhythm in her soul
But I’m too over the edge and I ain’t in the mood anymore to remember the times
When I was your only man
And she don’t want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world
Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love

Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a Wreckin’ lot outside of town about a mile
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust
She said, “Henry ain’t here but you can come on in, he’ll be back in a little while”

Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinking’ of
Bumming a ride back from where she started
But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up
She said, “Welcome to the land of the living dead”
You could tell she was so broken hearted
She said, “Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt”
“How far are y’all going?” Ruby asked us with a sigh
“We’re going all the way ’till the wheels fall off and burn
’Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies”
Ruby just smiled and said, “Ah, you know some babies never learn”

Something about that movie though, well I just can’t get it out of my head
But I can’t remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play
All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved
And a lot of them seemed to be looking’ my way


Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour
I was crossing’ the street when shots rang out
I didn’t know whether to duck or to run, so I ran
“We got him cornered in the churchyard,” I heard somebody shout

Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it
It said, “A man with no alibi”
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you
Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears
It was the best acting I saw anybody do
Now I’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line
Oh if there’s an original thought out there, I could use it right now
You know, I feel pretty good, but that is not saying’ much. I could feel a whole lot better
If you were just here by my side to show me how

Well, I’m standing’ in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck
Yeah, but you know it’s not the one that I had in mind
He’s got a new one out now, I don’t even know what it’s about
But I’ll see him in anything so I’ll stand in line


You know, it’s funny how things never turn out the way you had ’em planned
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn’t Henry Porter
And you know there was something’ about you baby that I liked that was always too good for this world
Just like you always said there was something’ about me you liked
That I left behind in the French Quarter

Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content
I don’t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I’m gone
You always said people don’t do what they believe in, they just do what’s most convenient, then they repent
And I always said, “Hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on”

There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice
I don’t remember who I was or where I was bound
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun
And he was shot in the back
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down"
Buckets of Rain,Buckets of Rain,Bob Dylan,"Buckets of rain
Buckets of tears
Got all them buckets comin’ out of my ears
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand

And hard like an oak
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear
If you want me
Honey baby, I’ll be here

I like your smile
And your fingertips
I like the way that you move your hips
I like the cool way you look at me
Everything about you is bringing me misery

Little red wagon
Little red bike
I ain’t no monkey, but I know what I like
I like the way you love me strong and slow
I’m taking you with me
Honey baby, when I go
Life is sad
Life is a bust
All you can do is do what you must
You do what you must do, and you do it well
I do it for you
Honey baby, can’t you tell?"
But Beautiful,But Beautiful,Bob Dylan,"Love is funny or it's sad
Or it's quiet or it's mad
It's a good thing or it's bad
But beautiful
Beautiful to take a chance and if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all
Love is tearful or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful
And I'm thinking if you were mine, I'd never let you go
And that would be but beautiful, I know

Love is tearful or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But it's beautiful
And I'm thinking if you were mine, I'd never let you go
And that would be but beautiful, I know"
Bye and Bye,Bye and Bye,Bob Dylan,"Bye and bye, I'm breathin' a lover's sigh
I'm sittin' on my watch so I can be on time
I'm singin' love's praises with sugar-coated rhyme
Bye and bye, on you I'm casting my eye
I'm paintin' the town—swinging my partner around
I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust
I'm watchin' the roads, I'm studying the dust
I'm paintin' the town making my last go-round
Well, I'm scufflin' and I'm shufflin' and I'm walkin' on briars
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires
I'm rollin' slow—I'm doing all I know
I'm tellin' myself I found true happiness
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed
I'm rollin' slow, goin' where the wild roses grow
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past
You were my first love and you will be my last
Papa gone mad, mamma, she's feeling sad
I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war
Gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be"
California,California,Bob Dylan,"I'm goin' down south
'Neath the borderline
I'm goin' down south
'Neath the borderline
Some fat momma
Kissed my mouth one time

Well, I knew it this morning
Without a shadow of doubt
I knew it this morning
Without a shadow of doubt
My suitcase is packed
My clothes are hangin' out

San Francisco is fine
You sure get lots of sun
San Francisco is fine
You sure get lots of sun
But I'm used to four seasons
California's got but one

Well, I got my dark sunglasses
I got for good luck my black tooth
I got my dark sunglasses
And for good luck I got my black tooth
Don't ask me nothin' about nothin'
I just might tell you the truth"
Call Letter Blues,Call Letter Blues,Bob Dylan,"Well, I walked all night long
Hearin' them church bells tone
Yes, I walked all night long
Listen to them church bells tone
Either someone needing mercy
Or might be somethin' I've done wrong

Well, your friends come by for you
I don't know what to say
Well, your friends come by for you
I don't know what to say
I just can't face to tell 'em
Honey, you just went away

The children cry for mother
I tell 'em, ""Mother took a trip""
Well, the children cry for mother
I tell 'em, ""Mother took a trip""
Well, I walk on pins and needles
I hope my tongue don't slip

Well, I gaze at passing strangers
In case I might see you
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers
In case I might see you
But the sun goes around the heavens
And another day just drives on through
Way out in the distance
I know you're with some other man
Way out in the distance
I know you're with some other man
But that's alright, baby
You know I always understand

Call girls in the doorway
All givin' me the eye
Call girls in the doorway
All givin' me the eye
But my heart's just not in it
I might as well pass right on by

My ears are ringin'
Ringin' like empty shells
My ears are ringin'
Ringin' like empty shells
Well, it can't be no guitar player
It must be combat bells"
Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?,Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?,Bob Dylan,"He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can’t answer him back
I’m sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it’s to say
That he needs you to test his inventions

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won’t ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it


Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little tin women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning"
Canadee-I-O,Canadee-I-O,Bob Dylan,"Well, it's all of fair and handsome girl
She's all in her tender years
She fell in love with a sailor boy
It's true she loved him well
For to go off to sea with him
Like she did not know how
She longed to see that seaport town
Of Canadee-i-o

So she bargained with the sailor boy
All for a piece of gold
Straightaway then he led her
Down into the hold
Sayin', ""I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes
Your jacket shall be blue
You'll see that seaport town
Of Canadee-i-o

Now, when the other sailors heard the news
Well, they fell into a rage
And with all the ship's company
They were willing to engage
Saying, ""We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys
Overboard we'll throw her
She'll never see that seaport town
Called Canadee-i-o
Now, when the captain he heard the news
Well, he too fell in a rage
And with the whole ship's company
He was willing to engage
Sayin', ""She'll stay in sailor's clothes
Her color shall be blue
She'll see that seaport town
Call Canadee-i-o

Now, when they come down to Canada
Scarcely 'bout half a year
She's married this bold captain
Who called her his dear
She's dressed in silks and satins now
She cuts a gallant show
Finest of the ladies
Down Canadee-i-o

Come, all you fair and tender girls
Wheresoever you may be
I'd have you to follow your own true love
Whene'er he goes to sea
For if the sailors prove false to you
Well, the captain, he might prove true
You'll see the honor I have gained
By the wearing of the blue"
Can’t Escape from You,Can’t Escape from You,Bob Dylan,"Oh the evening train is rolling
All along the homeward way
All my hopes are over the horizon
All my dreams have gone away
The hillside darkly shaded
Stars fall from above
All the joys of Earth have faded
The night's untouched, my love
I'll be here 'til tomorrow
Beneath a shroud of gray
I pretend I'm free of sorrow
My heart is miles away
The dead bells are ringing
My train is overdue
To your memory I'm clinging
I can't escape from you
Well I hear the sound of thunder
Roaring loud and long
Sometimes you've got to wonder
God knows I've done no wrong
You've wasted all your power
You threw out the Christmas pie
Now you're withering like a flower
You'll play the fool and die
I'm neither sad nor sorry
I'm all dressed up in black
I fought for fame and glory
You tried to break my back
In the far off sweet forever
The sunshine peeking through
We should have walked together
I can't escape from you
I cannot grasp the shadows
That gather near the door
Rain falls round my window
I wish I'd seen you more
The path is ever winding
The stars they never age
The morning light is blinding
All the world's a stage
Should be the time of gladness
Happy faces everywhere
The mystery of madness
Is propagating in the air
I don't like the city
Not like some folks do
Isn't it a pity
I can't escape from you
We plowed the fields of heaven
Right down to the end
I hope I can be forgiven
If any words of mine offend
All our days were splendid
They were simple, they were plain
It never should have ended
I should have kissed you in the rain
I've been thinking things all over
All the moments full of grace
The primrose and the clover
Your ever changing face
Can't help looking at you
You made love with god-knows-who
Never found a gal to match you
I can't escape from you"
Can’t Help Falling in Love,Can’t Help Falling in Love,Bob Dylan,"Wise men say, only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay, will it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you ?

Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you"
Can’t Leave Her Behind,Can't Leave Her Behind,Bob Dylan,"Where she leads me I do not know
Well, she leads me where she goes
I can't find her nowhere
Well, she needs me here
All aware I can't hear her walk
I just cannot hear her talk
Though sometimes, you know you will
And when she comes my way
I'll just be left any night or day
I will hear her say
That I don't wanna try
I tried, also cried
But I can't leave her behind"
Can’t Wait,Can't Wait,Bob Dylan,"I can’t wait, wait for you to change your mind
It’s late, I’m trying to walk the line
Well, it’s way past midnight and there are people all around
Some on their way up, some on their way down
The air burns and I’m trying to think straight
And I don’t know how much longer I can wait

I’m your man, I’m trying to recover the sweet love that we knew
You understand that my heart can’t go on beating without you
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I’m reeling from the blow
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so
I’m breathing hard, standing at the gate
But I don’t know how much longer I can wait

Skies are grey, I’m looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
Night or day, it doesn’t matter where I go anymore, I just go
If I ever saw you coming I don’t know what I would do
I’d like to think I could control myself, but it isn’t true
That’s how it is when things disintegrate
And I don’t know how much longer I can wait

I’m doomed to love you, I’ve been rolling through stormy weather
I’m thinking of you and all the places we could roam together
It’s mighty funny, the end of time has just begun
Oh, honey, after all these years you’re still the one
While I’m strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate
But I don’t know how much longer I can wait"

Caribbean Wind,Caribbean Wind,Bob Dylan,"She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy
Told about Jesus, told about the rain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
By a man who had been dying and disappeared so mysteriously

Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far
Were we sniper bait? Did we follow a star?
To a hole in the wall wall to where the long arm of the law can not reach?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech

And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire

She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore
She said, “We got a mutual friend over by the door
And you know he’s got our best interest in mind”
He was well connected but her heart was a snare
And she had left him to die in there
There were payments due and he was a little behind
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head
Ceiling fan broken, there’s a heat in my bed
Street band playing “Nearer My God to Thee”
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring
She said, “I know what you’re thinking, but there ain’t a thing
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree”

And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire

Atlantic City by the cold grey sea
I hear a voice crying, “Daddy,” I always think it’s for me
But it’s only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call
Every new messenger brings evil report
’Bout armies on the march and time that is short
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls

Would I have married her? I don’t know, I suppose
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes
But I kept hearing my name and had to be moving on
I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin
I saw a house in the country being torn from within
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire"
Catfish,Catfish,Bob Dylan,"Lazy stadium night
Catfish on the mound
“Strike three,” the umpire said
Batter have to go back and sit down

Catfish, million-dollar-man
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can

Used to work on Mr. Finley’s farm
But the old man wouldn’t pay
So he packed his glove and took his arm
And one day he just ran away


Come up where the Yankees are
Dress up in a pinstripe suit
Smoke a custom-made cigar
Wear an alligator boot

Carolina born and bred
Love to hunt the little quail
Got a hundred-acre spread
Got some huntin’ dogs for sale


Reggie Jackson at the plate
Seeing’ nothing’ but the curve
Swing too early or too late
Got to eat what Catfish serve


Even Billy Martin grins
When the Fish is in the game
Every season twenty wins
Gonna make the Hall of Fame"
Cat’s in the Well,Cat’s in the Well,Bob Dylan,"The cat’s in the well, the wolf is looking down
The cat’s in the well, the wolf is looking down
He got his big bushy tail dragging all over the ground

The cat’s in the well, the gentle lady is asleep
Cat’s in the well, the gentle lady is asleep
She ain’t hearing a thing, the silence is a-stickin’ her deep
The cat’s in the well and grief is showing its face
The world’s being slaughtered and it’s such a bloody disgrace

The cat’s in the well, the horse is going bumpety bump
The cat’s in the well, and the horse is going bumpety bump
Back alley Sally is doing the American jump
The cat’s in the well, and Papa is reading the news
His hair’s falling out and all of his daughters need shoes

The cat’s in the well and the barn is full of bull
The cat’s in the well and the barn is full of bull
The night is so long and the table is oh, so full
The cat’s in the well and the servant is at the door
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war

The cat’s in the well, the leaves are starting to fall
The cat’s in the well, leaves are starting to fall
Goodnight, my love, may the Lord have mercy on us all"
Changing of the Guards,Changing of the Guards,Bob Dylan,"Sixteen years
Sixteen banners united over the fields
Where the good shepherd grieves
Desperate men, desperate women divided
Spreading their wings 'neath falling leaves

Fortune calls
I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born
On Midsummer's Eve near the tower

The cold-blooded moon
The captain waits above the celebration
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
Whose ebony face is beyond communication
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid

They shaved her head
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil
I stumbled to my feet
I rode past destruction in the ditches
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you

The palace of mirrors
Where dog soldiers are reflected
The endless road and the wailing of chimes
The empty rooms where her memory is protected
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times

She wakes him up
Forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long golden locks

Gentlemen, he said I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards
But Eden is burning either get ready for elimination
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards
Peace will come
With tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire
But will offer no reward when her false idols fall
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating
Between the King and the Queen of Swords"
Chimes of Freedom,Chimes of Freedom,Bob Dylan,"Far between sundown’s finish and midnight’s broken toll
We ducked inside the doorways, thunder went crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seemin' to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Through the city’s melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin’ rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked it's poems in naked wonder
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leavin' only bells of lightning and it's thunder
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
And the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute
For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Even though a cloud’s white curtain in a far-off corner flared
And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin'
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look
Spellbound and swallowed ’til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'"

Clean Cut Kid,Clean Cut Kid,Bob Dylan,"Everybody wants to know why he couldn’t adjust
Adjust to what, a dream that bust?

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

They said what’s up is down, they said what isn’t is
They put ideas in his head he thought were his


He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand


He went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout
For his friends he would turn his pockets inside out

They said, “Listen boy, you’re just a pup”
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills
A jeep to drive, blood to spill
They said “Congratulations, you got what it takes”
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes


He bought the American dream but it put him in debt
The only game he could play was Russian roulette
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread
Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O’Toole
He stole a Rolls-Royce and drove it in a swimming pool


He could’ve sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar
Could’ve been an accountant or a tennis star
He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans
They got to sleep together in a home they don’t own


Well, everybody’s asking why he couldn’t adjust
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust
They took his head and turned it inside out
He never did know what it was all about
He had a steady job, he joined the choir
He never did plan to walk the high wire"
Cocaine Blues,Cocaine Blues,Bob Dylan,"Everytime my baby and me go up town
Police come and they knock me down
Cocaine, all around my brain
Hey baby, better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain
Yonder comes by baby, she's dressed in red
She's got a shot-gun, says she's gonna kill me dead
Cocaine, all around my brain
Hey baby, better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain
Early one morning, half past four
Cocaine came knockin' on my door
Cocaine, all around my brain
Hey baby, you better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain
Cocaine's for horses and it's not for men
Doctor said it kill you, but he don't say when
Cocaine, all around my brain
Hey baby, you better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain"
Cold Irons Bound,Cold Irons Bound,Bob Dylan,"I’m beginning to hear voices and there’s no one around
Well, I’m all used up and the fields have turned brown
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by
My love for her is taking such a long time to die
I’m waist deep, waist deep in the mist
It’s almost like, almost like I don’t exist
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

The walls of pride are high and wide
Can’t see over to the other side
It’s such a sad thing to see beauty decay
It’s sadder still to feel your heart torn away
One look at you and I’m out of control
Like the universe has swallowed me whole
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

There’s too many people, too many to recall
I thought some of ’m were friends of mine, I was wrong about ’m all
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside’s mud
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood
I found my world, found my world in you
But your love just hasn’t proved true
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

Oh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds
Reality has always had too many heads
Some things last longer than you think they will
There are some kind of things you can never kill
It’s you and you only I been thinking about
But you can’t see in and it’s hard lookin’ out
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

Well the fat’s in the fire and the water’s in the tank
The whiskey’s in the jar and the money’s in the bank
I tried to love and protect you because I cared
I’m gonna remember forever the joy that we shared
Looking at you and I’m on my bended knee
You have no idea what you do to me
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound"
Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies,Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies,Bob Dylan,"Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Be careful how you court young men
They're like a star on a summer's morning
They'll first appear and then they're gone
They'll tell you some loving story
They'll declare to you their love is true
Then they will go and court some other
And that's the love they have for you
Do you remember our days of courting
When your head lay upon my breast
You could make me believe with falling of your arm
That the sun rose in the West
I wish I was a little sparrow
And I had wings with which to fly
Right over to see my false true-lover
And when he's talking I'd be nigh
But I'm not a little sparrow
I have no wings with which to fly
So I sit here in grief and sorrow
To weep and pass my troubles by
If I had known before I courted
That love was such a killing thing
I'd a-locked my heart in a box of golden
And fastened it up with a silver pin"
Come Rain or Come Shine,Come Rain or Come Shine,Bob Dylan,"I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain and deep as a river
Come rain or come shine
I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gon' be true if you let me
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And won't that be fine?
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine"
Coming From The Heart,Coming From The Heart,Bob Dylan,"By Bob Dylan and Helena Springs
We have got to come together
How long can we stay apart?
You may get it maybe never
But it's coming from the heart
Your life is full of indecision
You can't make up your mind
We must get it in position
And move it on down the line
'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
I been on that road too long of a time
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
When I think of the love that I left behind
Make me up a bed of roses
And hang them down from the vine
Of all my loves you've been the closest
That's ever been on my mind
Please don't talk about tomorrow
I'm really not one to care
This world is filled with too much sorrow
That nobody's heart should bear
'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
I been on that road too long of a time
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
When I think of the love that I left behind
Please, please give me indication
Stop and talk to me
Like a river that is flowing
My love will never cease to be
You will always be my honey
No one could take your part
Our love can't be bought with money
'Cause it's coming from the heart
'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
I been on that road too long of a time
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
When I think of the love that I left behind"
Confidential,Confidential,Bob Dylan,"Confidential as a baby's kiss
Smooth like a baby's breath
Your love for me will always be
Confidential to me
Oh, to look..."
Cool Water,Cool Water,Bob Dylan,"..and I’m a fool
Each star’s a pool of water, cool clear water
But with the dawn I’ll wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Cool, clear water
The shadows sway and seem to say
“Tonight we pray for water
Cool, clear water.”
And way up there He’ll hear our prayer
And show us where there’s water
Cool, clear water
Keep a-movin’, Dan, don’t you listen to him, Dan
He’s a devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can you see that big green tree
Where the water’s running free
And it’s waiting there for you and me
Cool, clear water
Dan’s feet are sore, he’s yearning for
Just one thing more than water
Cool, clear water
Like me, I guess, he’d like to rest
Where there’s no quest for water
Cool, clear water"
Copper Kettle,Copper Kettle,Bob Dylan,"Get you a copper kettle
Get you a copper coil
Fill it with new made corn mash
And never more you'll toil
You'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling
In the pale moonlight
Build you a fire with hickory
Hickory, ash, and oak
Don't use no green or rotten wood
It'll get you by the smoke
We'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling
In the pale moonlight
My daddy, he made whiskey
My granddaddy, he did too
We ain't paid no whiskey tax
Since 1792
We'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling
In the pale moonlight"

Country Pie,Country Pie,Bob Dylan,"Just like old Saxophone Joe
When he’s got the hogshead up on his toe
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

Listen to the fiddler play
When he’s playin' 'til the break of day
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime
What do I care?
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum
Call me for dinner, honey, I’ll be there

Saddle me up my big white goose
Tie me on her and turn her loose
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

I don’t need much, that ain’t no lie
Ain’t runnin' any race
Give to me my country pie
I won’t throw it up in anybody’s face
Shake me up that old peach tree
A'Little Jack Horner got nothin’ on me
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie"
Covenant Woman,Covenant Woman,Bob Dylan,"Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Way up yonder, great will be her reward
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star
I know I can trust you to stay where you are

And I just got to tell you
I do intend
To stay closer than any friend
I just got to thank you
Once again
For making your prayers known
Unto heaven for me
And to you, always, so grateful
I will forever be

I’ve been broken, shattered like an empty cup
I’m just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up
And I know He will do it ’cause He’s faithful and He’s true
He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you


Covenant woman, intimate little girl
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world
You know we are strangers in a land we’re passing through
I’ll always be right by your side, I’ve got a covenant too"

I don't want you hangin' around my mate; wanna use her for myself
You know you caught me crawlin'
Baby, when the, when the grass was very high
I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now, baby, until the day I die
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den
Don't want you hangin' around my mate; wanna use her for myself
You know I'm gon' crawl up to your window, baby
Wanna crawl up to your door; you got anything I want, baby?
Wanna crawl up on your floor

Crossing the Rubicon,Crossing the Rubicon,Bob Dylan,"I crossed the Rubicon on the 14th day
Of the most dangerous month of the year
At?the?worst time, at?the worst place
That's all I seem?to hear
I got up early
So I can greet the goddess?of?the?dawn
I've painted my?wagon, abandoned all?hope
And I crossed the Rubicon

Well, the Rubicon is a red river
Goin' gently as she flows
Redder than your ruby lips
And the blood that flows from the rose
Three miles north of purgatory
One step from the great beyond
I prayed to the cross, I kissed the girls
And I crossed the Rubicon

What are these dark days I see?
In this world so badly bent
I cannot redeem the time
The time so idly spent
How much longer can it last?
How long can it go on?
I embrace my love, put down my hair
And I crossed the Rubicon
I can feel the bones beneath my skin
And they're tremblin' with rage
I'll make your wife a widow
You'll never see old age
Show me one good man in sight
That the sun shines down upon
I pawned my watch, I paid my debts
And I crossed the Rubicon

Put my hide up on a hill
Where some happiness I'll find
If I survive, then let me love
Let the hour be mine
Take the high road, take the low
Take any one you're on
I poured the cup, I passed it along
And I crossed the Rubicon

Well, you defiled the most lovely flowers
In all her womanhood
Others can be tolerant
Others can be good
I'll cut you up with a crooked knife
Lord, and I'll miss you when you're gone
I stood between Heaven and Earth
And I crossed the Rubicon
You won't find any happiness here
No happiness or joy
Go back to the gutter, try your luck
Find you some nice pretty boy
Tell me how many men I need
And who can I count upon
I strapped my belt, I buttoned my coat
And I crossed the Rubicon

I feel the holy spirit inside
See the light that freedom gives
I believe it's in the reach of
Every man who lives
Keep as far away as possible
It's darkest 'fore the dawn (Oh Lord)
I turned the key, I broke it off
And I crossed the Rubicon

Mona, baby, are you still in my mind?
I truly believe that you are
Couldn't be anybody else but you
Who's come with me this far
The killing frost is on the ground
And the autumn leaves are gone
I lit the torch, I looked to the east
And I crossed the Rubicon"
Cry a While,Cry a While,Bob Dylan,"Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith
A nasty, dirty, double-crossin’, backstabbin’ phony I didn’t wanna have to be dealin’ with
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile
Well, I cried for you—now it’s your turn to cry awhile
I don’t carry deadweight—I’m no flash in the pan
All right, I’ll set you straight, can’t you see I’m a union man?
I’m lettin’ the cat out of the cage, I’m keeping a low profile
Well, I cried for you—now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile
Feel like a fighting rooster—feel better than I ever felt
But the Pennsylvania line’s in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile
Well, I cried for you—now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile
Last night ’cross the alley there was a pounding on the walls
It must have been Don Pasqualli makin’ a two A.M. booty call
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style
Well, I cried for you—now it’s your turn to cry awhile
I’m on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can’t control
Some people they ain’t human, they got no heart or soul
Well, I’m crying to the Lord—I’m tryin’ to be meek and mild
Yes, I cried for you—now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile
Well, there’s preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs
I’m longin’ for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs
I’m gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey—I’ll die before I turn senile
Well, I cried for you—now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile
Well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way
I always said you’d be sorry and today could be the day
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial
Well, I cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile"
Dark Eyes,Dark Eyes,Bob Dylan,"Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside
They’re drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
I live in another world where life and death are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all I see are dark eyes

A cock is crowing far away and another soldier’s deep in prayer
Some mother’s child has gone astray, she can’t find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
Whom nature’s beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes

They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I’m sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes

Oh, the French girl, she’s in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes"
"Day In, Day Out","Day In, Day Out",Bob Dylan,"Day in, day out
The same old voodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And darling, I think of you, day in and day out
Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I awake with a tingle, one possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you
Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in, day out
Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in, day out
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in, day out"
Day of the Locusts,Day of the Locusts,Bob Dylan,"Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration
The birdies were flying from tree to tree
There was little to say, there was no conversation
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree
And the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me

I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb
I was ready to leave, I was already walking
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me

Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading
The weather was hot, a-nearly 90 degrees
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn’t fall on me
Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me
I put down my robe, picked up my diploma
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota
Sure was glad to get out of there alive
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
And the locusts sang with a high whining trill
Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me
Singing for me, well, singing for me"
Days of 49,Days of 49,Bob Dylan,"I'm old Tom Moore from the bummer's shore in that good old golden days
They call me a bummer and a ginsot too, but what cares I for praise ?
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
And all the people say, ""There goes Tom Moore, in the days of '49""

In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

My comrades they all loved me well, a jolly saucy crew
A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49

In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

There was New York Jake, the butcher boy, he was always getting tight
And every time that he'd get full he was spoiling for a fight
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same
He would ante up and draw his cards and he would you go a hatful blind
In the game with death Bill lost his breath, in the days of '49

In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo, I never will forget
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet
One day he fell in a prospect hole, in a roaring bad design
And in that hole he roared out his soul, in the days of '49

In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49
Of the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
And I'm left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost
And I pass by from town to town, they call me a rambling sign
""There goes Tom Moore, a bummer shore in the days of '49 ""

In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49"
"Dead Man, Dead Man","Dead Man, Dead Man",Bob Dylan,"Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine
Never being able to separate the good from the bad
Ooh, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it
It’s making me feel so sad

Dead man, dead man
When will you arise?
Cobwebs in your mind
Dust upon your eyes

Satan got you by the heel, there’s a bird’s nest in your hair
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move
Ooh, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it
What are you trying to prove?


The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you end up in
The race of the engine that overrules your heart
Ooh, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it
Pretending that you’re so smart

What are you trying to overpower me with, the doctrine or the gun?
My back is already to the wall, where can I run?
The tuxedo that you’re wearing, the flower in your lapel
Ooh, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it
You want to take me down to hell"
Dear Landlord,Dear Landlord,Bob Dylan,"Dear landlord
Please don’t put a price on my soul
My burden is heavy
My dreams are beyond control
When that steamboat whistle blows
I’m gonna give you all I got to give
And I do hope you receive it well
Depending on the way you feel that you live

Dear landlord
Please heed these words that I speak
I know you’ve suffered much
But in this you are not so unique
All of us, at times, we might work too hard
To have it too fast and too much
And anyone can fill his life up
With things he can see but he just cannot touch

Dear landlord
Please don’t dismiss my case
I’m not about to argue
I’m not about to move to no other place
Now, each of us has his own special gift
And you know this was meant to be true
And if you don’t underestimate me
I won’t underestimate you"

Now he went up to grade school and he wrote back to his folks
He drew such funny pictures and was always pulling jokes
This world was lucky to see him born
He went up to Harvard to read his books of law
He loved his trees and horses, he loved everything he saw
This world was lucky to see him born
He got struck down by the fever and it settled in his leg
He loved the folks that wished him well and everybody did
This world was lucky to see him born
He took office on a crippled leg and he said to one and all
""Your money changing racket, boys, sure enough got to fall.""
This world was lucky to see him born
I voted for him lots of times and I'd vote for him again
He tried to find an honest job for every idle man
This world was lucky to see him born
He helped me to build my union and he learned me how to talk
I could see he was a cripple but he learned my soul to talk
This world was lucky to see him born
I was a GI in the army the day he passed away
And over my shoulder I could hear some soldier say
""This world was lucky to see him born.""
I know this world was lucky just to see him born
I know this world was lucky just to see him born
This world was lucky to see him born"

Death Is Not the End,Death Is Not the End,Bob Dylan,"When you’re sad and when you’re lonely
And you haven’t got a friend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all that you’ve held sacred
Falls down and does not mend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

When you’re standing at the crossroads
That you cannot comprehend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all your dreams have vanished
And you don’t know what’s up the bend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

When the storm clouds gather ’round you
And heavy rains descend
Just remember that death is not the end
And there’s no one there to comfort you
With a helping hand to lend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
Oh, the tree of life is growing
Where the spirit never dies
And the bright light of salvation shines
In dark and empty skies

When the cities are on fire
With the burning flesh of men
Just remember that death is not the end
And you search in vain to find
Just one law-abiding citizen
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end"
Delia,Delia,Bob Dylan,"Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down
All the friends I ever had are gone

Delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out West
When she returned, little Delia gone to rest
All the friends I ever had are gone

Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's momma moaned
Wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home
All the friends I ever had are gone

Curtis' looking high, Curtis' looking low
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel forty-four
All the friends I ever had are gone

High up on the housetops, high as I can see
Looking for them rounders, looking out for me
All the friends I ever had are gone

Men in Atlanta, tryin' to pass for white
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight
All the friends I ever had are gone
Judge says to Curtis, ""What's this noise about?""
""All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out.""
All the friends I ever had are gone

Curtis said to the judge, ""What might be my fine?""
Judge says, ""Poor boy, you got ninety-nine.""
All the friends I ever had are gone

Curtis' in the jail house, drinking from an old tin cup

Desolation Row,Desolation Row,Bob Dylan,"They’re selling postcards of the hanging
They’re painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They’ve got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants

And the riot squad, they’re restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row

Cinderella, she seems so easy
""It takes one to know one,"" she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning
“You Belong to Me, I Believe”
And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place, my friend
You'd better leave”
And the only sound that’s left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row

Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain

And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing
He’s getting ready for the show
He’s going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row

Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession’s her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah’s great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row

Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
Now he looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet

You would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They’re trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She’s in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
“Have mercy on his soul”
They all play on the pennywhistle
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row

Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains
They’re getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
In a perfect image of a priest
They are spoon feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words

And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls
“Get outta here if you don’t know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row”

At midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene

Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row

Praise be to Nero’s Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody’s shouting
“Which side are you on?”
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain’s tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers

Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row


Yes, I received your letter yesterday
About the time the doorknob broke
When you asked me how I was doing
Was that some kinda joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name

Right now, I can’t read too good
Don’t send me no more letters, no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row"
Diamond Joe,Diamond Joe,Bob Dylan,"Now There's a man you'll hear about
Most anywhere you go
And his holdings are in Texas
And his name is Diamond Joe

And he carries all his money
In a diamond-studded jar
He never took much trouble
With the process of the law

I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys
Did offer him my hand
He gave a string of horses
So old they could not stand

And I nearly starved to death, boys
He did mistreat me so
And I never saved a dollar
In the pay of Diamond Joe

Now his bread it was corn dodger
And his meat you couldn't chaw
Nearly drove me crazy
With the wagging of his jaw
And the telling of his story
Mean to let you know
That there never was a rounder
That could lie like Diamond Joe
Instrumental

Now, I tried three times to quit him
But he did argue so
I'm still punching cattle
In the pay of Diamond Joe

And when I'm called up yonder
And it's my time to go
Give my blankets to my buddies
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe"
Dignity,Dignity,Bob Dylan,"Fat man looking in a blade of steel
Thin man looking at his last meal
Hollow man looking in a cotton field
For dignity

Wise man looking in a blade of grass
Young man looking in the shadows that pass
Poor man looking through painted glass
For dignity

Somebody got murdered on New Year’s Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun

Searching high, searching low
Searching everywhere I know
Asking the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?

Blind man breaking out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hoping to find one circumstance
Of dignity
I went to the wedding of Mary Lou
She said, “I don’t want nobody see me talking to you”
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity

I went down where the vultures feed
I would’ve gone deeper, but there wasn’t any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasn’t any difference to me

Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, going to ask the maid
Have you seen dignity?

Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors
Looking into the lost forgotten years
For dignity

Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said he’d give me information if his name wasn’t used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused
By dignity
Footprints running across the silver sand
Steps going down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the border towns of despair

Got no place to fade, got no coat
I’m on the rolling river in a jerkin boat
Trying to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity

Sick man looking for the doctor’s cure
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
For dignity

Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams
So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, I’m at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what it’s going to take
To find dignity"
Dink’s Song,Dink's Song,Bob Dylan,"If I had wings
Like Noah's Dove
I’d fly the river
To the one I love
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

I had a man
Who was long and tall
Moved his body
Like a cannonball
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

Remember one evening
Was drizzling rain
And around my heart
I felt an aching pain
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

Once I wore
My apron low
Couldn’t keep you
Away from my door
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well
Now my apron
Is up to my chin
You pass my door
But you never come in
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

Oh, mighty river
Runs muddy and wild
Can’t care the bloody
For my unborn child
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

Number 9 train
Won’t do no harm
Number 9 train
Take my poor baby home
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

Fastest man
I ever saw
Skipped Missouri
On the way to Arkansas
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well"
Dirge,Dirge,Bob Dylan,"I hate myself for loving’ you and the weakness that it showed
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel
I hate myself for loving’ you and I’m glad the curtain fell

I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin

Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped
Like a slave in orbit, he’s beaten ’till he’s tame
All for a moment’s glory and it’s a dirty, rotten shame

There are those who worship loneliness, I’m not one of them
In this age of fiberglass I’m searching for a gem
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn’t shown me nothing yet
I’ve paid the price of solitude, but at least I’m out of debt

Can’t recall a useful thing you ever did for me
’Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees
We stared into each other’s eyes ’till one of us would break
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I’m at
I hate myself for loving’ you, but I should get over that"
Dirt Road Blues,Dirt Road Blues,Bob Dylan,"Gone walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride
Gone walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride
If I can’t find my baby, I’m gonna run away and hide

I have been pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back
Pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back
Well, I have been praying for salvation laying ’round in a one-room country shack

Gone walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
Gone walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
’Till there’s nothing left to see, ’tell the chains have been shattered
And I’ve been freed

I been looking at my shadow, I have been watching the colors up above
Looking at my shadow watching the colors up above
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love

Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same
I keep on walking 'til I hear her holler out my name"
Disease of Conceit,Disease of Conceit,Bob Dylan,"There’s a whole lot of people suffering tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people struggling tonight
From the disease of conceit
Comes right down the highway
Straight down the line
Rips into your senses
Through your body and your mind
Nothing about it that’s sweet
The disease of conceit

There’s a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight
From the disease of conceit
Steps into your room
Eats your soul
Over your senses
You have no control
Ain’t nothing too discreet
About the disease of conceit

There’s a whole lot of people dying tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people crying tonight
From the disease of conceit
Comes right out of nowhere
And you’re down for the count
From the outside world
The pressure will mount
Turn you into a piece of meat
The disease of conceit
Conceit is a disease
That the doctors got no cure
They’ve done a lot of research on it
But what it is, they’re still not sure

There’s a whole lot of people in trouble tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people seeing double tonight
From the disease of conceit
Give ya delusions of grandeur
And a evil eye
Give you the idea that
You’re too good to die
Then they bury you from your head to your feet
From the disease of conceit"
Dixie,Dixie,Bob Dylan,"I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away to Dixie Land

In Dixie Land where i was born
Early on one frosty morn
Look away, look away, look away to Dixie Land

I wish I was in Dixie
Away, away
In Dixie Land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Away, away, away down south in Dixie
Away, away, away down south in Dixie

I wish I was in Dixie
Away, away
In Dixie Land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Away, away, away down south in Dixie

Do Re Mi,Do Re Mi,Bob Dylan,"Lots of folks back east they say
""Hello"" every day
Hitting the hard old dusty way to the California line
Across that desert sand they go
They're getting out of the old dust bowl
They think they're going to a sugar bowl
But here is what they find
Oh the police at the port of entry say
""You're number fourteen thousand for today""
And, well if you ain't got the do re mi, boy
If you ain't got the do re mi
Better go on back to beautiful Texas
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee
California is the garden of eden
A paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not
You won't find it so hot
If you ain't got the do re mi
If you want a house or farm
That won't do nobody harm
Take your vacation by the mountains or the sea
Don't swap that old cow for a car
Better stay right where you are
You had better take this tip from me
Cause I read it in the want ads every day
And the headlines on the papers always say
If you ain't got the do re mi, boy
If you ain't got the do re mi
Better go on back to beautiful Texas

A paradise to live in or see

Don’t Fall Apart on Me Tonight,Don’t Fall Apart on Me Tonight,Bob Dylan,"Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door
What is it that you’re trying to achieve, girl?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Who’ve lost all ray of hope
You know, it's not even safe no more
In the palace of the Pope
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday’s just a memory
Tomorrow is never what it’s supposed to be
And I need you, yeah

Come over here from over there, girl
Sit down here, you can have my chair
I can’t see us goin' anywhere, girl
The only place open is a thousand miles away
And I can’t take you there
I wished I’d have been a doctor
Maybe I’d have saved some life that've been lost
Maybe I’d have done some good in the world
Instead of burning every bridge I crossed
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday’s just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it’s supposed to be
And I need you, ah, yeah

I ain't too good at conversation, girl
So you might not know exactly how I feel
But if I could I’d bring you to the mountain top, girl
And build you a house made out of stainless steel
But it’s like I’m stuck inside a painting
That’s a-hanging in the Louvre
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches
But I know that I can’t move

Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday’s gone but the past live' on
Tomorrow's just one step beyond
And I need you, ah
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through
Can they tell you what’s wrong from what’s right?
Oh, do you remember St. James Street
Where you blew Jackie P.’s mind?
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And laid his life on the line
Let’s try to get beneath the surface waste, girl
No more booby traps and bombs
No more decadence and charms
No more affection that’s misplaced, girl
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms
What about that millionaire
With the drumsticks in his pants?
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
When he played and we didn’t dance

Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday is just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it’s supposed to be

Yeah, you, ah

And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right

So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you anymore
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
So long, honey babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say, ""Fare thee well""
I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
You could've done better, but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right"

Dreamin’ of You,Dreamin’ of You,Bob Dylan,"The light in this place is really bad
Like being at the bottom of a stream
Any minute now
I’m expecting to wake up from a dream

Means so much, the softest touch
By the grave of some child, who neither wept or smiled
I pondered my faith in the rain
I’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
And it’s driving me insane

Somewhere dawn is breaking
Light is streaking across the floor
Church bells are ringing
I wonder who they’re ringing for

Travel under any star
You’ll see me wherever you are
The shadowy past is awake and so vast
I’m sleeping in the palace of pain
I’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
But it’s driving me insane
Maybe they’ll get me, maybe they won’t
But whatever it won’t be tonight
I wish your hand was in mine right now
We could go where the moon is white

For years they had me locked in a cage
Then they threw me onto the stage
Some things just last longer than you thought they would
And they never, ever explain
I’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
And it’s driving me insane

Well, I eat when I’m hungry, drink when I’m dry
Live my life on the square
Even if the flesh falls off my face
It won’t matter, long as you’re there

Feel like a ghost in love
Underneath the heavens above
Feel further away than I ever did before
Feel further than I can take
Dreaming’ of you is all I do
But it’s driving me insane
Everything in the way is so shiny today
A queer and unusual fall
Spirals of golden haze, here and there in a blaze
Like beams of light in the storm

Maybe you were here and maybe you weren’t
Maybe you touched somebody and got burnt
The silent sun has got me on the run
Burning a hole in my brain
I’m dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
But it’s driving me insane"
Drifter’s Escape,Drifter's Escape,Bob Dylan,"“Oh, help me in my weakness”

As they carried him from the courtroom
And were taking him away
“My trip hasn’t been a pleasant one
And my time it isn’t long
And I still do not know
What it was that I’ve done wrong”

Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside
A tear came to his eye
“You fail to understand,” he said
“Why must you even try?”
Outside, the crowd was stirring
You could hear it from the door
Inside, the judge was stepping down
While the jury cried for more

“Oh, stop that cursed jury”
Cried the attendant and the nurse
“The trial was bad enough
But this is ten times worse”
Just then a bolt of lightning
Struck the courthouse out of shape
And while ev’rybody knelt to pray
The drifter did escape"
Driftin’ Too Far from Shore,Driftin’ Too Far from Shore,Bob Dylan,"I didn’t know that you’d be leaving’
Or who you thought you were talking’ to

Or maybe I’m one up on you

I send you all my money
Just like I did before
I tried to reach you honey
But you’re drifting too far from shore

Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore

I ain’t gonna get lost in this current
I don’t like playing cat and mouse
No gentleman likes making love to a servant
Especially when he’s in his father’s house

I never could guess your weight, baby
Never needed to call you my whore
I always thought you were straight, baby
But you’re drifting too far from shore

Well these times and these tunnels are haunted
The bottom of the barrel is too
I waited years sometimes for what I wanted
Everybody can’t be as lucky as you

Never no more do I wonder
Why you don’t never play with me anymore
At any moment you could go under
’Cause you’re drifting too far from shore


You and me we had completeness
I give you all of what I could provide
We weren’t on the wrong side, sweetness
We were the wrong side

I’ve already ripped out the phones, honey
You can’t walk the streets in a war
I can finish this alone honey
You’re drifting too far from shore"

In their big mother hubbards and their stockin' feet

Blowing like my woman's on board

Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away
You old rascal, I know exactly where you're going
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead

Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Blowing through another no good town
The lights on my native land are glowing
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she's blowing right on time"
Dusty Old Fairgrounds,Dusty Old Fairgrounds,Bob Dylan,"By Bob Dylan
Well, it's all up from Florida at the start of the spring
The trucks and the trailers will be winding
Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling
From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun
'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling
Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen
'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling
As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels
I've gazed from the trailer window laughing
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling
It's a-many a friend that follows the bend
The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers
Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind
Following them fairgrounds a-calling
Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents
Get that canvas flag a-flying
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind
Following them fairgrounds a-calling
Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds
Just behind the posters that are hanging
And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face
Following them fairgrounds a-calling
Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind
Hear that old music box a-banging
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling
It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town
Hit the old highway by the morning
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time
Following them fairgrounds a-calling
As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime
Drinking red wine as we're rolling
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn
From following them fairgrounds a-calling
And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em
And the money that we made will pay for the space
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling"
Early Mornin’ Rain,Early Mornin' Rain,Bob Dylan,"In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go

Cut on runway number nine, big 707 set to go
I'm stuck here on the ground, where the cold winds blow
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
There she goes, my friend, she's rolling down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Because I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunks as I might be
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain"
Early Roman Kings,Early Roman Kings,Bob Dylan,"All the early Roman Kings in their sharkskin suits
Bowties and buttons, high top boots
Driving the spikes in, blazing the rails
Nailed in their coffins in top hats and tails
Fly away little bird, fly away, flap your wings
Fly by night like the early Roman Kings
All the early Roman Kings in the early, early morn’
Coming down the mountain, distributing the corn
Speeding through the forest, racing down the track
You try to get away, they drag you back
Tomorrow is Friday, we’ll see what it brings
Everybody’s talking ‘bout the early Roman Kings
They’re peddlers and they’re meddlers, they buy and they sell
They destroyed your city, they’ll destroy you as well
They’re lecherous and treacherous, hell bent for leather
Each of them bigger than all men put together
Sluggers and muggers wearing fancy gold rings
All the women going crazy for the early Roman Kings
I'll dress up your wounds with a blood clotted rag
I ain’t afraid to make love to a bitch or a hag
If you see me coming and you’re standing there
Wave your handkerchief in the air
I ain’t dead yet, my bell still rings
I keep my fingers crossed like the early Roman Kings
I'll strip you of life, strip you of breath
Ship you down to the house of death
One day you will ask for me
There’ll be no one else that you’ll want to see
Bring down my fiddle, tune up my strings
Gonna break it wide open like the early Roman Kings
I was up on black mountain the day Detroit fell
They killed them all off and they sent them to hell
Ding Dong Daddy, you’re coming up short
Gonna put you on trial in a Sicilian court
I’ve had my fun, I’ve had my flings
Gonna shake ‘em all down like the early Roman Kings"
Emotionally Yours,Emotionally Yours,Bob Dylan,"Come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun
Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you’re the one
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors
But I will always be emotionally yours

Come baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart
Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start
I could be dreaming but I keep believing you’re the one I’m living for
And I will always be emotionally yours

It’s like my whole life never happened
When I see you, it’s as if I never had a thought
I know this dream, it might be crazy
But it’s the only one I’ve got

Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied
Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide
I could be unraveling wherever I’m traveling, even to foreign shores
But I will always be emotionally yours"
Endless Highway,Endless Highway,Bob Dylan,"Take a silver dollar and put it in your pocket
Never let it slip away
Always be a man, not a boy gone astray
When ya get half cra-zy from the August heat
Or on a frozen, rotted road
With no one to complain to about your achin' feet

You're gonna walk that endless highway
Walk that high-way till you die
All you children goin' my way
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye
When I see a detour up ahead
Well, I leave it far behind
Who knows what you're apt to find there
With the cost of livin, and the price of dyin'
Well it look like t'me this time I won't be buyin'

When they get a scapegoat by the throat
It's hard labour and cold beans
If ya get away real quick
You'll be eatin from the poison peanut machine
Well, I sing by night, wander by day
I'm on the road and it looks like I'm here to stay"
Eternal Circle,Eternal Circle,Bob Dylan,"I sang the song slowly
As she stood in the shadows
She stepped to the light
As my silver strings spun
She called with her eyes
To the tune I’s a-playing
But the song it was long
And I’d only begun

Through a bullet of light
Her face was reflecting
The fast fading words
That rolled from my tongue
With a long-distance look
Her eyes was on fire
But the song it was long
And there was more to be sung

My eyes danced a circle
Across her clear outline
With her head tilted sideways
She called me again
As the tune drifted out
She breathed hard through the echo
But the song it was long
And it was far to the end
I glanced at my guitar
And played it pretending
That of all the eyes out there
I could see none
As her thoughts pounded hard
Like the pierce of an arrow
But the song it was long
And it had to get done

As the tune finally folded
I laid down the guitar
Then looked for the girl
Who’d stayed for so long
But her shadow was missing
For all of my searching
So I picked up my guitar
And began the next song"
Every Grain of Sand,Every Grain of Sand,Bob Dylan,"In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
There’s a dyin’ voice within me reaching out somewhere
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair

Don’t have the inclination to look back on any mistake
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master’s hand
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand

Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay

I gaze into the doorway of temptation’s angry flame
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand

I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer’s dream, in the chill of a wintry light
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn, there’s someone there, other times it’s only me
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand"
Everything Is Broken,Everything Is Broken,Bob Dylan,"Broken lines, broken strings
Broken threads, broken springs
Broken idols, broken heads
People sleeping in broken beds
Ain’t no use jiving
Ain’t no use joking
Everything is broken

Broken bottles, broken plates
Broken switches, broken gates
Broken dishes, broken parts
Streets are filled with broken hearts
Broken words never meant to be spoken
Everything is broken
Seem like every time you stop and turn around
Something else just hit the ground

Broken cutters, broken saws
Broken buckles, broken laws
Broken bodies, broken bones
Broken voices on broken phones
Take a deep breath, feel like you’re choking
Everything is broken
Every time you leave and go off someplace
Things fall to pieces in my face

Broken hands on broken ploughs
Broken treaties, broken vows
Broken pipes, broken tools
People bending broken rules
Hound dog howling, bullfrog croaking
Everything is broken"
False Prophet,False Prophet,Bob Dylan,"Another day that don't end
Another ship goin' out
Another day of anger, bitterness, and doubt
I know?how?it happened
I saw?it begin
I opened my heart to?the world and the world came in

Hello, Mary Lou
Hello, Miss?Pearl
My?fleet-footed?guides from the?underworld
No stars in?the sky shine brighter than you
You girls mean business and I do too

Well, I'm the enemy of treason
An enemy of strife
I'm the enemy of the unlived meaningless life
I ain't no false prophet
I just know what I know
I go where only the lonely can go

I'm first among equals
Second to none
The last of the best
You can bury the rest
Bury 'em naked with their silver and gold
Put 'em six feet under and I pray for their souls
What are you lookin' at?
There's nothing to see
Just a cool breeze that's encircling me
Let's go for a walk in the garden
So far and so wide
We can sit in the shade by the fountain-side

I search the world over
For the Holy Grail
I sing songs of love
I sing songs of betrayal
Don't care what I drink
I don't care what I eat
I climb the mountains with swords on my bare feet

You don't know me, darlin'
You never would guess
I'm nothing like my ghostly appearance would suggest
I ain't no false prophet
I just said what I said
I'm just here to bring vengeance on somebody's head

Put out your hand
There's nothing to hold
Open your mouth
I'll stuff it with gold
Oh, you poor devil, look up if you will
The city of God is there on the hill
Hello, stranger
Hello and goodbye
You ruled the land
But so do I
You lusty old mule
You got a poisoned brain
I'll marry you to a ball and chain

You know, darlin'
The kind of life that I live
When your smile meets my smile
Something's got to give
I ain't no false prophet
No, I'm nobody's bride
Can't remember when I was born
And I forgot when I died"
Farewell,Farewell,Bob Dylan,"Oh it’s fare thee well my darling’ true
I’m leaving’ in the first hour of the morn
I’m bound off for the bay of Mexico
Or maybe the coast of Californ
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leavin’
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind

Oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard
And the rain she’s a-turnin’ into hail
I still might strike it lucky on a highway going’ west
Though I’m traveling’ on a path beaten trail
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving’
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind

I will write you a letter from time to time
As I’m rambling’ you can travel with me too
With my head, my heart and my hands, my love
I will send what I learn back home to you
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving’
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind
I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles
Be them somebody else’s or my own
With my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high
I will travel unnoticed and unknown
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind

I’ve heard tell of a town where I might as well be bound
It’s down around the old Mexican plains
They say that the people are all friendly there
And all they ask of you is your name
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind"
Father of Night,Father of Night,Bob Dylan,"Father of night, Father of day
Father, who taketh the darkness away
Father, who teacheth the bird to fly
Builder of rainbows up in the sky
Father of loneliness and pain
Father of love and Father of rain

Father of day, Father of night
Father of black, Father of white
Father, who build the mountain so high
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky
Father of time, Father of dreams
Father, who turneth the rivers and streams

Father of grain, Father of wheat
Father of cold and Father of heat
Father of air and Father of trees
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories
Father of minutes, Father of days
Father of whom we most solemnly praise"
Five Feet High and Rising,Five Feet High and Rising (Ft. Johnny Cash),Bob Dylan,"My mama always taught me that good things come from adversity if we put our?faith?in the Lord
We?couldn't see much good in the?flood waters
When they were causing us to have to leave home
But when the water went down, we found that it had washed a load of rich black bottom dirt across our land. The following year we had the best cotton crop we'd ever had
I remember hearing:
How high's the water, mama?
Two feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa?
Two feet high and risin'
We can make it to the road in a homemade boat
That's the only thing we got left that'll float
It's already over all the wheat and the oats
Two feet high and risin'
How high's the water, mama?
Three feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa?
Three feet high and risin'
Well, the hives are gone
I've lost my bees
The chickens are sleepin'
In the willow trees
Cow's in water up past her knees
Three feet high and risin'
How high's the water, mama?
Four feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa?
Four feet high and risin'
Hey, come look through the window pane
The bus is comin', gonna take us to the train
Looks like we'll be blessed with a little more rain
Four feet high and risin'
How high's the water, mama?
Five feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa?
Five feet high and risin'
Well, the rails are washed out north of town
We gotta head for higher ground
We can't come back till the water comes down
Five feet high and risin'
Well, it's five feet high and risin'"

Floater (Too Much to Ask),Floater (Too Much to Ask),Bob Dylan,"Down over the window
Comes the dazzling sunlit rays
Through the back alleys—through the blinds
Another one of them endless days
Honey bees are buzzing
Leaves begin to stir
I’m in love with my second cousin
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her
I keep listening for footsteps
But I ain’t hearing any
From the boat I fish for bullheads
I catch a lot, sometimes too many
A summer breeze is blowing
A squall is settin’ in
Sometimes it’s just plain stupid
To get into any kind of wind
The old men ’round here, sometimes they get
On bad terms with the younger men
But old, young, age don’t carry weight
It doesn’t matter in the end
One of the boss’ hangers-on
Comes to call at times you least expect
Try to bully ya—strong-arm you—inspire you with fear
It has the opposite effect
There’s a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town
The old one is long gone
Timber two-foot-six across
Burns with the bark still on
They say times are hard, if you don’t believe it
You can just follow your nose
It don’t bother me—times are hard everywhere
We’ll just have to see how it goes
My old man, he’s like some feudal lord
Got more lives than a cat
Never seen him quarrel with my mother even once
Things come alive or they fall flat
You can smell the pinewood burning
You can hear the school bell ring
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can
If you wanna learn anything
Romeo, he said to Juliet, “You got a poor complexion
It doesn’t give your appearance a very youthful touch!”
Juliet said back to Romeo, “Why don’t you just shove off
If it bothers you so much”
They all got out of here any way they could
The cold rain can give you the shivers
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee
All the rest of them rebel rivers
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again
You do so at the peril of your own life
I’m not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound
I’ve seen enough heartaches and strife
My grandfather was a duck trapper
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth
I don’t know if they had any dreams or hopes
I had them once though, I suppose, to go along
With all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all of the Christmas eves
I left all my dreams and hopes
Buried under tobacco leaves
It’s not always easy kicking someone out
Gotta wait a while—it can be an unpleasant task
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
And tears or not, it’s too much to ask"
Folsom Prison Blues,Folsom Prison Blues,Bob Dylan,"I hear that train a-coming, it's coming round the bend
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
But I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, time keeps dragging on
And that train keeps on rolling down to San Antone
When I was just a baby my mamma told me; ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't fool around with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing I hang my head and cry
I bet there's rich folks eating in fancy dining cars
I bet they're drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-moving, and that's what torture me
Well if they'd free me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
You bet I moved it on down, a little further down the line
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I wanna stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away"
Foot of Pride,Foot of Pride,Bob Dylan,"Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male
They sang “Danny Boy” at his funeral and the Lord’s Prayer
Preacher talking ’bout Christ betrayed
It’s like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up
Sooner or later you gonna meet them coming down

Well, there ain’t no goin’ back
When your foot of pride come down
Ain’t no goin’ back

Hear ya got a brother named James, don’t forget faces or names
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed
Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
And your fall-by-the sword love affair with Errol Flynn
In these times of compassion when conformity’s in fashion
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in

There’s a retired businessman named Red
Cast down from heaven and he’s out of his head
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
He’s not somebody that you play around with much
Miss Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is
She’ll do wondrous works with your fate
Feed you coconut bread
Spice buns in your bed
If you don’t mind sleeping with your head face down in a grave


Well, they’ll choose a man for you to meet tonight
You’ll play the fool and learn how to walk through the doors
How to enter into the gates of paradise
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
Yeah, from the stage they’ll be trying’ to get water out rocks
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in
Sing “Amazing Grace” all the way to the Swiss banks

They got some beautiful people out there, man
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue
They got mystery written all over their forehead
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
They don’t believe in mercy
Judgement on them is something that you’ll never see
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route
Turn you into anything that they want you to be


Yes, I guess I loved him too
I can still see him in my mind climbin’ that hill
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped
Struck down by the strength of the will
Ain’t nothin’ left here partner, just the dust of a plague
That has left this whole town afraid
From now on, this’ll be where you’re from
Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade"

Forgetful Heart,Forgetful Heart,Bob Dylan,"Forgetful heart
Lost your power of recall
Every little detail
You don't remember at all
The times we knew
Who would remember better than you

Forgetful heart
We laughed and had a good time you and I
It's been so long
Now you're content to let the days go by
When you were there
You were the answer to my prayer

Forgetful heart
We loved with all the love that life can give
What can I say
Without you it's so hard to live
Can't take much more
Why can't we love like we did before

Forgetful heart
Like a walking shadow in my brain
All night long
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain
The door has closed forevermore
If indeed there ever was a door"

And I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if you ever come this way
Think I'll go down to Alberta
Where there's good there in the fall
I've got some friends that I can go workin' for
But I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All these things that don't change
Come what may
But the good times are all gone
And I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if you ever come this way
(A few lines are inaudible)
But by then it would be springtime
There ain't too much for you to do
So I see you when I pass this way again
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All these things that won't change
Come what may
But the good times are all gone
And I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way"
Frankie & Albert,Frankie & Albert,Bob Dylan,"Frankie was a good girl
Everybody knows
Paid one hundred dollars
For Albert's new suite of clothes
He was her man but he done her wrong
Albert said, ""I'm leaving you
Won't be gone for long
Don't wait up for me
Or worry about me when I'm gone""
He was her man but he done her wrong
Frankie went down to the corner saloon
Get a bucket of beer
Said to the bartender
""Has my lovin' man been here?""
He was her man but he done her wrong
""Well, I ain't gonna tell you no stories
I ain't gonna tell you no lies
I saw Albert an hour ago
With a gal named Alice Bly""
He was her man but he done her wrong
Frankie went down to 12th street
Lookin' up through the window high
She saw her Albert there
Lovein' up Alice Bly
He was her man but he done her wrong
Frankie pulled out a pistol
Pulled out a forty-four
Gun went off a rootie-toot-toot
And Albert fell on the floor
He was her man but he done her wrong
Frankie got down upon her knees
Took Albert into her lap
Started to hug and kiss him
But there was no bringin' him back
He was her man but he done her wrong
""Gimme a thousand policemen
Throw me into a cell
I shot my Albert dead
And now I'm goin' to hell
He was her man but he done me wrong""
Judge said to the jury
""plain as a thing can be
A woman shot her lover down
Murder in the second degree""
He was her man but he done her wrong
Frankie went to the scaffold
Calm as a girl could be
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens
Said, ""nearer, my god, to thee""
He was her man but he done her wrong"

Lord, have mercy, what you gonna do about the people who are praying to you?
They got men making laws that destroy other men
They've made money ""God""
It's a doggone sin
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way
Big ship's a-sailing, slaves all chained and bound
Heading for a brand new land that some cat said he upped and found
Lord, have mercy, what you gonna do about the people who are praying to you?
They got men making laws that destroy other men
They've made money ""God""
It's a doggone sin
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way
Some sing a sad song
Some got to moan the blues
Trying to make the best of a home
That the man didn't even get to choose
Lord, have mercy, how you gonna be with people like John and me
They've got men building fences to keep other men out
Ignore him if he whispers and kill him if he shouts

Freight Train Blues,Freight Train Blues,Bob Dylan,"I was born in Dixie in a boomer shed
Just a little shanty by the railroad track
Freight train was it taught me how to cry
The holler of the driver was my lullaby
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I got to go baby, don't you know
Well, it looks like I'm never going to lose the freight train blues

Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama-ha
She was the only daughter of an engineer
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke
Seems a waste to get a good man broke
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I got to go mama, don't you know
Well, it looks like I'm never going to lose the freight train blues

Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train
Every place I want to go I never can go
Because you know I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes"

From a Buick 6,From a Buick 6,Bob Dylan,"I got this graveyard woman, you know
She keeps my kids
But my soulful mama, you know
She keeps me hid
She’s a junkyard angel, and she
Always gives me bread

Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

Well, when the pipeline gets broken
And I'm lost on the river bridge
I’m all cracked up on the highway
And in the water’s edge
Here again she comes, down the thruway
Ready to sew me up with a thread

Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

Well, she don’t make me nervous
She don’t talk too much
She walks like Bo Diddley
And she don’t need no crutch
She keeps this .410
All loaded with lead
Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

Come on!

Well, you know I
Need a steam shovel, mama, to
Keep away the dead
I need a dump truck, baby, to
Unload my head
She brings me everything and more
And just like I said

Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed"
Full Moon and Empty Arms,Full Moon and Empty Arms,Bob Dylan,"Full moon and empty arms
The moon is there for us to share
But where are you?
A night like this could weave a memory
And every kiss could start a dream for two
Full moon and empty arms
Tonight I'll use the magic moon to wish upon
And next full moon
If my one wish comes true
My empty arms will be filled with you"
Gamblin’ Willie’s Dead Man’s Hand (Limited Release Only),Gamblin' Willie's Dead Man's Hand (Limited Release Only),Bob Dylan,"Come around you rovin’ gamblers and a story I will tell
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well
His name was Will O’Conley and he gambled all his life
He had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows
He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards
He had the reputation as the gamblin’est man around
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows
Sailin’ down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans
They’re still talkin’ about their card game on that Jackson River Queen
“I’ve come to win some money,” Gamblin’ Willie says
When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true
He supported all his children and all their mothers too
He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore
He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Whether he was bluffin’ or whether he was true
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn’t even have a pair
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows
It was late one evenin’ during a poker game
A man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate
When Willie’s cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows
So all you rovin’ gamblers, wherever you might be
The moral of the story is very plain to see
Make your money while you can, before you have to stop
For when you pull that dead man’s hand, your gamblin’ days are up
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows"
Gates of Eden,Gates of Eden,Bob Dylan,"Of war and peace the truth just twists
It's curfew gull it glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds
The cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun
Though its glow is waxed in black
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden
The lamppost stands with folded arms
It's iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
Though it shadows metal badge
All and all can only fall
With a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
But still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the Gates of Eden
With a time-rusted compass blade
Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Side saddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise
You will not hear a laugh
All except inside the Gates of Eden
Relationships of ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly
And wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden
The motorcycle black Madonna
Two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden
The kingdoms of experience
In the precious winds they rot
While paupers change possessions
Each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince
Discuss what's real and what is not
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden
The foreign sun, it squints upon
A bed that is never mine
As friends and other strangers
From their fates try to resign
Leaving men wholly totally free
To do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden
At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words
But these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden"
George Jackson,George Jackson,Bob Dylan,"I woke up this morning
There were tears in my bed
They killed a man I really loved
Shot him through the head
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord, they laid him in the ground
Sent him off to prison
For a seventy dollar robbery
Closed the door behind him
And they threw away the key
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord, they laid him in the ground
He wouldn't take shit from no one
He wouldn't bow down or kneel
Authorities, they hated him
Because he was just too real
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord, they laid him in the ground
Prison guards, they cursed him
As they watched him from above
But they were frightened of his power
They were scared of his love
Lord, Lord, so they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord, they laid him in the ground
Sometimes I think this whole world
Is one big prison yard
Some of us are prisoners
The rest of us are guards
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord, they laid him in the ground"
Get Your Rocks Off,Get Your Rocks Off,Bob Dylan,"You know there's two old maids layin' in the bed
One picked up an' the other one she said
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me
Well, you know there late one night up on Blueberry Hill
One man turned to the other man an' said with a blood curdlin' chill, he said
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me
Well, you know we was layin' down around Mink Muscle Creek
One man said to the other man he began to speak, he said
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me
Well, you know we was cruisin' down the highway in a Greyhound bus
All kinds of little children on the sideroad they was hollerin' at us, sayin'
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me"

Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine
If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds
Please see if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see from me if her hair is hanging long
For that's the way I remember her best
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all
So many times I've thought and prayed
In the darkness of my night
And the brightness of my days

But it’s been so strong for so long

God knows everything
God knows it could snap apart right now
Just like putting scissors to a string

God knows it’s terrifying
God sees it all unfold
There’s a million reasons for you to be crying
You been so bold and so cold
God knows that when you see it
God knows you’ve got to weep
God knows the secrets of your heart
He’ll tell them to you when you’re asleep

God knows how to make it flow
God knows you ain’t gonna be taking
Nothing with you when you go

God knows there’s a chance
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour
Of any circumstance

God knows it’s out of sight
God knows we can get all the way from here to there

Golden Loom,Golden Loom,Bob Dylan,"Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
And then I turn my head, for you’re approaching me
Moonlight on the water, fisherman’s daughter, floating in to my room
With a golden loom

First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste
And then you drift away on a summer’s day where the wildflowers bloom
With your golden loom

I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil
But you’re gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
And your golden loom"

If you'll fill up my jug
With that good old mountain dew
Well, there's my old Aunt June
Bought some brand new perfume
It had such a sweet smellin' phew
But to her surprise, when she had it analyzed
It was nothing but good old mountain dew
And there's Uncle Mort
He's sawed off and short
He's just five feet and one inch or two
But he thinks he's a giant
When he gets him a pint
Of that good old mountain dew
Now, there's Uncle Bill
Got a still on the hill
Where he runs off a gallon or two
And the buzzards in the sky
Get so dizzy they can't fly
Just from smelling that mountain dew"

Give me that old time religion, it's just what I need

For thine is kingdom, the power, the glory

Tell it in that straightforward, puritanical tone
In the mystic hours when a person's alone
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, godspeed
Thump on the Bible, proclaim a creed

You won't amount to much, the people all said
'Cause I didn't play guitar behind my head
Never pandered, never acted proud
Never took off my shoes, throw 'em in the crowd
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye, goodnight
Put a jewel in your crown and I put out the lights

They threw everything at me, everything in the book
I had nothing to fight with but a butcher's hook
They had no pity, they never lend a hand
I can't sing a song that I don't understand
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye, good luck
I can't play the record 'cause my needle got stuck
Transparent woman in a transparent dress
Suits you well, I must confess
I'll break open your grapes, I'll suck out the juice
I need you like my head needs a noose
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye and so long
I thought I could resist her but I was so wrong

God be with you, brother dear
If you don't mind me asking what brings you here?
Oh, nothing much, I'm just looking for the man
Need to see where he's lying in this lost land
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, and everything within ya
Can't you hear me calling from down in Virginia?"

"Grammy Speech, 2015 from NYT","Grammy Speech, 2015 from NYT",Bob Dylan,"FEBRUARY 7, 2015, 2:13 PM _
There are a few people we need to thank tonight for bringing about this grand event. Neil Portnow, Dana Tamarkin, Rob Light, Brian Greenbaum, Don Was. And also want to thank President Carter for coming. It’s been a long night, and I don’t want to talk too much, but I’ll say a few things. I'm glad for my songs to be honored like this. But you know, they didn't get here by themselves. It's been a long road and it's taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, I think of as mystery plays, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they're on the fringes now. And they sound like they've been traveling on hard ground. I need to mention a few people along the way who brought this about. I know I should mention John Hammond, the great talent scout, who way back when brought me to Columbia Records. He signed me to that label when I was nobody. It took a lot of faith to do that, and he took a lot of ridicule, but he was his own man and he was courageous. And for that, I'm eternally grateful. The last person he discovered before me was Aretha Franklin, and before that Count Basie, Billie Holiday and a whole lot of other artists. All non-commercial artists. Trends did not interest John, and I was very noncommercial but he stayed with me. He believed in my talent and that's all that mattered. I can't thank him enough for that. Lou Levy ran Leeds Music, and they published my earliest songs, but I didn't stay there too long. Levy himself, he went back a long ways. He signed me to that company and recorded my songs and I sang them into a tape recorder. He told me outright, there was no precedent for what I was doing, that I was either before my time or behind it. And if I brought him a song like ""Stardust,"" he'd turn it down because it would be too late. He told me that if I was before my time -- and he didn't really know that for sure -- but if it was happening and if it was true, the public would usually take three to five years to catch up -- so be prepared. And that did happen. The trouble was, when the public did catch up I was already three to five years beyond that, so it kind of complicated it. But he was encouraging, and he didn't judge me, and I'll always remember him for that. Artie Mogull at Witmark Music signed me next to his company, and he told me to just keep writing songs no matter what, that I might be on to something. Well, he too stood behind me, and he could never wait to see what I'd give him next. I didn't even think of myself as a songwriter before then. I'll always be grateful for him also for that attitude.I also have to mention some of the early artists who recorded my songs very, very early, without having to be asked. Just something they felt about them that was right for them. I've got to say thank you to Peter, Paul and Mary, who I knew all separately before they ever became a group. I didn't even think of myself as writing songs for others to sing but it was starting to happen and it couldn't have happened to, or with, a better group. They took a song of mine that had been recorded before that was buried on one of my records and turned it into a hit song. Not the way I would have done it -- they straightened it out. But since then hundreds of people have recorded it and I don't think that would have happened if it wasn't for them. They definitely started something for me. The Byrds, the Turtles, Sonny & Cher -- they made some of my songs Top 10 hits but I wasn't a pop songwriter and I really didn't want to be that, but it was good that it happened. Their versions of my songs were like commercials, but I didn't really mind that because 50 years later my songs were being used in the commercials. So that was good too. I was glad it happened, and I was glad they'd done it. Pervis Staples and the Staple Singers -- long before they were on Stax they were on Epic and they were one of my favorite groups of all time. I met them all in '62 or '63. They heard my songs live and Pervis wanted to record three or four of them and he did with the Staples Singers. They were the type of artists that I wanted recording my songs, if anybody was going to do it. Nina Simone. I used to cross paths with her in New York City in the Village Gate nightclub. She was an artist a definitely looked up to. She recorded some of my songs that she learned directly from me, sitting in a dressing room. She was an overwhelming artist, piano player and singer. Very strong woman, very outspoken and dynamite to see perform. That she was recording my songs validated everything that I was about. Nina was the kind of artist that I loved and admired. Oh, and can't forget Jimi Hendrix. I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform when he was in a band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames -- something like that. And Jimi didn't even sing. He was just the guitar player. After he became famous, he took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and pumped them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere and turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here. Johnny Cash recorded some of my songs early on, too, I met him in about '63, when he was all skin and bones. He traveled long, he traveled hard, but he was a hero of mine. I heard many of his songs growing up. I knew them better than I knew my own. ""Big River,"" ""I Walk the Line."" ""How High’s The Water, Mama?"" I wrote ""It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)"" with that song reverberating inside my head. I still ask, ""How high is the water, mama?"" Johnny was an intense character. And he saw that people were putting me down playing electric music, and he posted letters to magazines scolding people, telling them to shut up and let him sing. In Johnny Cash's world -- hardcore Southern drama -- that kind of thing didn't exist. Nobody told anybody what to sing or do. They just didn't do that kind of thing where he came from. I'm always going to thank him for that. Johnny Cash was a giant of a man, the man in black. And I'll always cherish the friendship we had until the day there is no more days. Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Joan Baez. She was the queen of folk music then and now. She took a liking to my songs and brought me with her to play concerts, where she had crowds of thousands of people enthralled with her beauty and voice. People would say, ""What are you doing with that ragtag scrubby looking waif?"" And she'd tell everybody in no uncertain terms, ""Now you better be quiet and listen to the songs."" We even played a few of them together. Joan Baez is as tough-minded as they come. Loyal, free minded and fiercely independent. Nobody can tell her what to do if she doesn't want to do it. I learned a lot of things from her. A woman of devastating honesty. And for her kind of love and devotion, I could never pay that back. These songs didn't come out of thin air. I didn't just make them up out of whole cloth. Contrary to what Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional music: traditional folk music, traditional rock 'n' roll and traditional big-band swing orchestra music. I learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them, back when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me the code for everything that's fair game, that everything belongs to everyone. For three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses, fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one song and sing it next in an hour if I'd heard it just once. If you sang ""John Henry"" as many times as me -- ""John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer in his hand / John Henry said a man ain't nothin' but a man / Before I let that steam drill drive me down / I'll die with that hammer in my hand.""If you had sung that song as many times as I did, you'd have written ""How many roads must a man walk down?"" too. Big Bill Broonzy had a song called ""Key to the Highway."" ""I've got a key to the highway / I'm booked and I'm bound to go / Gonna leave here runnin' because walking is most too slow."" I sang that a lot. If you sing that a lot, you just might write, Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose Welfare Department they wouldn’t give him no clothes He asked poor Howard where can I go Howard said there’s only one place I know Sam said tell me quick man I got to run Howard just pointed with his gun And said that way down on Highway 61 You'd have written that too if you'd sang ""Key to the Highway"" as much as me. ""Ain't no use sit 'n cry / You'll be an angel by and by / Sail away, ladies, sail away."" ""I'm sailing away my own true love."" ""Boots of Spanish Leather"" -- Sheryl Crow just sung that. ""Roll the cotton down, aw, yeah, roll the cotton down / Ten dollars a day is a white man's pay / Roll the cotton down/A dollar a day is the black man's pay / Roll the cotton down."" If you sang that song as many times as me, you'd be writing ""I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,"" too. If you’d had listened to the Robert Johnson singing, “Better come in my kitchen, ‘cause it’s gonna be raining out doors,” as many time as I listened to it, sometime later you just might write, “A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall.” I sang a lot of ""come all you"" songs. There's plenty of them. There's way too many to be counted. ""Come along boys and listen to my tale / Tell you of my troubles on the old Chisholm Trail."" Or, ""Come all ye good people, listen while I tell / the fate of Floyd Collins, a lad we all know well.” ""Come all ye fair and tender ladies / Take warning how you court your men / They're like a star on a summer morning / They first appear and then they're gone again."" And then there’s this one, ""Gather 'round, people / A story I will tell / 'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, the outlaw / Oklahoma knew him well.""If you sung all these ""come all ye"" songs all the time like I did, you'd be writing, ""Come gather 'round people where ever you roam, admit that the waters around you have grown / Accept that soon you'll be drenched to the bone / If your time to you is worth saving / And you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone / The times they are achanging."" You'd have written that too. There's nothing secret about it. You just do it subliminally and unconsciously, because that's all enough, and that's all you know. That was all that was dear to me. They were the only kinds of songs that made sense. ""When you go down to Deep Ellum keep your money in your socks / Women on Deep Ellum put you on the rocks."" Sing that song for a while and you just might come up with, ""When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too / And your gravity’s down and negativity don't pull you through / Don’t put on any airs / When you’re down on Rue Morgue Avenue / They got some hungry women there / And they really make a mess outta you."" All these songs are connected. Don't be fooled. I just opened up a different door in a different kind of way. It's just different, saying the same thing. I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary. Well you know, I just thought I was doing something natural, but right from the start, my songs were divisive for some reason. They divided people. I never knew why. Some got angered, others loved them. Didn't know why my songs had detractors and supporters. A strange environment to have to throw your songs into, but I did it anyway. Last thing I thought of was who cared about what song I was writing. I was just writing them. I didn't think I was doing anything different. I thought I was just extending the line. Maybe a little bit unruly, but I was just elaborating on situations. Maybe hard to pin down, but so what? A lot of people are hard to pin down and you’ve just got to bear it. In a sense everything evened itself out. Leiber and Stoller didn’t think much of my songs. They didn't like 'em, but Doc Pomus did. That was all right that they didn't like 'em, because I never liked their songs either. ""Yakety yak, don't talk back."" ""Charlie Brown is a clown,"" ""Baby I'm a hog for you."" Novelty songs, not serious. Doc's songs, they were better. ""This Magic Moment."" ""Lonely Avenue."" “Save the Last Dance for Me.” Those songs broke my heart. I figured I'd rather have his blessings any day than theirs. Ahmet Ertegun didn't think much of my songs, but Sam Phillips did. Ahmet founded Atlantic Records. He produced some great records: Ray Charles, Ruth Brown, LaVerne Baker, just to name a few. There were some great records in there, no doubt about it. But Sam Phillips, he recorded Elvis and Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Radical artists that shook the very essence of humanity. Revolutionaries with vision and foresight. Fearless and sensitive at the same time. Revolution in style and scope. Radical to the bone. Songs that cut you to the bone. Renegades in all degrees, doing songs that would never decay, and still resound to this day. Oh, yeah, I'd rather have Sam Phillips' blessing any day. Merle Haggard didn't think much of my songs, but Buck Owens did, and Buck even recorded some of my early songs. Now I admire Merle -- ""Mama Tried,"" ""Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down,"" ""I'm a Lonesome Fugitive."" I understand all that but I can't imagine Waylon Jennings singing ""The Bottle Let Me Down."" I love Merle but he’s not Buck. Buck Owens wrote ""Together Again"" and that song trumps anything that ever came out of Bakersfield. Buck Owens and Merle Haggard? If you have to have somebody's blessing -- you figure it out. What I’m saying here is that my songs seem to divide people. Even people in the music community. People in the critical world too. Critics have always been on my tail since day one. Seems like they’ve always given me special treatment. Some of the music critics say I can't sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why don't these same critics say similar things about Tom Waits? They say my voice is shot. That I have no voice. Why don't they say those things about Leonard Cohen? Why do I get special treatment? Critics say I can't carry a tune and I talk my way through a song. Really? I've never heard that said about Lou Reed. Why does he get to go scot-free? What have I done to deserve this special treatment? Why me lord? No vocal range? When's the last time you’ve read that about Dr. John? You’ve never read that about Dr John. Why don't they say that about him? Slur my words, got no diction. You have to wonder if these critics have ever heard Charley Patton or Son House or Wolf. Talk about slurred words and no diction. Why don’t they say those same things about them. ""Why me, Lord?"" Critics say I mangle my melodies, render my songs unrecognizable. Oh, really? Let me tell you something. I was at a boxing match a few years ago seeing Floyd Mayweather fight a Puerto Rican guy. And the Puerto Rican national anthem, somebody sang it and it was beautiful. It was heartfelt and it was moving. After that it was time for our national anthem. And a very popular soul-singing sister was chosen to sing. She sang every note - - that exists, and some that don't exist. Talk about mangling a melody. You take a onesyllable word and make it last for 15 minutes? She was doing vocal gymnastics like she was a trapeze act. But to me it was not funny.Where were the critics? Mangling lyrics? Mangling a melody? Mangling a treasured song? No, I get the blame. But I don't really think I do that. I just think critics say I do. Sam Cooke said this when told he had a beautiful voice: He said, ""Well that's very kind of you, but voices ought not to be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter only if they convince you that they are telling the truth."" Think about that the next time you are listening to a singer. Times always change. They really do. And you have to always be ready for something that's coming along and you never expected it. Way back when, I was in Nashville making some records and I read this article, a Tom T. Hall interview. Tom T. Hall, he was bitching about some kind of new song, and he couldn't understand what these new kinds of songs that were coming in were about. Now Tom, he was one of the most preeminent songwriters of the time in Nashville. A lot of people were recording his songs and he himself even did it. But he was all in a fuss about James Taylor, a song James had called ""Country Road."" Tom was going off in this interview -- ""But James don't say nothing about a country road. He's just says how you can feel it on the country road. I don't understand that."" Now some might say Tom is a great songwriter. I'm not going to doubt that. At the time he was doing this interview I was actually listening to a song of his on the radio. It was called ""I Love."" I was listening to it in a recording studio, and he was talking about all the things he loves, an everyman kind of song, trying to connect with people. Trying to make you think that he's just like you and you're just like him. We all love the same things, and we're all in this together. Tom loves little baby ducks, slow-moving trains and rain. He loves old pickup trucks and little country streams. Sleep without dreams. Bourbon in a glass. Coffee in a cup. Tomatoes on the vine, and onions. Now listen, I'm not ever going to disparage another songwriter. I'm not going to do that. I'm not saying it's a bad song. I'm just saying it might be a little overcooked. But, you know, it was in the top 10 anyway. Tom and a few other writers had the whole Nashville scene sewed up in a box. If you wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go to them, and Tom was one of the top guys. They were all very comfortable, doing their thing. This was about the time that Willie Nelson picked up and moved to Texas. About the same time. He's still in Texas. Everything was very copacetic. Everything was all right until -- until -- Kristofferson came to town. Oh, they ain't seen anybody like him. He came into town like a wildcat that he was, flew a helicopter into Johnny Cash'sbackyard, not your typical songwriter. And he went for the throat. ""Sunday Morning Coming Down."" Well, I woke up Sunday morning With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt. And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad So I had one more for dessert Then I fumbled through my closet Found my cleanest dirty shirt Then I washed my face and combed my hair And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day. You can look at Nashville pre-Kris and post-Kris, because he changed everything. That one song blew ol’ Tom T. Hall's world apart. He couldn’t see it coming. It might have sent him to the mad house. God forbid he ever heard any of my songs. You walk into the room With your pencil in your hand You see somebody naked You say, “Who is that man?” You try so hard But you don’t understand Just what you're gonna say When you get home But you don’t know what it is Do you, Mister Jones? If ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" rattled Tom's cage, sent him into the loony bin, my song surely would have made him blow his brains out, right there in the loony bin. Hopefully he didn't hear it.I just released an album of standards, all the songs usually done by Michael Buble, Harry Connick Jr., maybe Brian Wilson's done a couple, Linda Ronstadt done 'em. Rod of course, even Paul has done some of this kind of material. But the reviews of their records aren’t like mine. In their reviews no one says anything. In my reviews, they've got to look under every stone and report about it. In the review they get, you seldom see any of the songwriters names. Unlike mine. They've got to mention all the songwriters' names. Well that's OK with me. After all, they're great songwriters and these are standards. I've seen the reviews come in, and they'll mention all the songwriters in half the review, as if everybody knows them. Nobody's heard of them, not in this time, anyway. Buddy Kaye, Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh, to name a few. But, you know, I'm glad they mention their names, and you know what? I'm glad they got their names in the press. It might have taken some time to do it, but they're finally there with importance and dignity. I can only wonder why it took so long. My only regret is that they're not here to see it. Traditional rock 'n' roll, we're talking about that. It's all about rhythm. Johnny Cash said it best: ""Get rhythm. Get rhythm when you get the blues."" Very few rock 'n' roll bands today play with rhythm. They don't know what it is. Rock 'n' roll is a combination of blues, and it's a strange thing made up of two parts. A lot of people don't know this, but the blues, which is an American music, is not what you think it is. It's a combination of Arabic violins and Strauss waltzes working it out. But it's true. The other half of rock 'n' roll has got to be hillbilly. And that's a derogatory term, but it ought not to be. That's a term that includes the Delmore Bros., Stanley Bros., Roscoe Holcomb, Git Tanner and the Skillet Lickers ... groups like that. Moonshine gone berserk. Fast cars on dirt roads. That's the kind of combination that makes up rock 'n' roll, and it can't be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio. You have to have the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music. If you can't hardly play the blues, and you don’t have the hillbilly feeling, you’re not really playing Rock n Roll. It might be something else but it’s not that. You can fake it, but you can't make it. Critics have said that I’ve made a career out of confounding expectations. Really? Because that's all I do? That's how I think about it. Confounding expectations. Like I stay up late at night thinking about how to do it. ""What do you do for a living, man?"" ""Oh, I confound expectations."" You're going to get a job, the man says, ""What do you do?"" ""Oh, confound expectations.: And the man says, ""Well, we already have that spot filled. Call us back. Or don't call us, we'll call you."" Confounding expectations. I don’t even know what that means or who has time for it.‘Why me, Lord? My work confounds them obviously, but I really don't know how I do it. The Blackwood Bros. have been talking to me about making a record together. That might confound expectations, but it shouldn't. Of course it would be a gospel album. I don't think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me. Not a bit. One of the songs I'm thinking about singing is ""Stand By Me"" with the Blackwood Brothers. Not ""Stand By Me"" the pop song. No. The real ""Stand By Me."" The real one goes like this: When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the world is tossing me / Like a ship upon the sea / Thou who rulest wind and water / Stand by me In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / When the hosts of hell assail / And my strength begins to fail / Thou whomever lost a battle / Stand by me In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / When I do the best I can / And my friends don't understand/ Thou who knowest all about me / Stand by me That's the song. I like it better than the pop song. If I record one by that name, that's going to be the one. I'm also thinking of recording a song, not for that album, though – a song called ""Oh Lord, Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood."" But I don’t know, it might be good on the gospel album too. Anyway, I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I'm honored to have all these artists singing my songs. There's nothing like that. Great artists. Who all know how to sing the truth, and you can hear it in their voices. I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I think a lot of this organization. They've helped many people. Many musicians who have contributed a lot to our culture. I'd like to personally thank them for what they did for a friend of mine, Billy Lee Riley. A friend of mine who they helped for six years when he was down and couldn't work. Billy was a Sun rock 'n' roll artist. He was a true original. He did it all; played, sang and wrote. He would have been a bigger star but Jerry Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that comes along. You kind of have to take a step back. You just don't stand a chance. So Billy became what is known in the industry -- a condescending term, by the way -- as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, once in a while, a one hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star who's got 20 or 30 hits behind him. And Billy's hit song was called ""Red Hot,"" and it was red hot. It could blast you out of your skull and make you feel happy about it. Change your life. He did it with power and style and grace. You won't find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He's not there. Metallica is. Abba is. Mamas and the Papas -- I know they're in there. Jefferson Airplane, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan -- I've got nothing against Metal, Soft Rock, Hard Rock, Psychedelic Pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff. But after all, it is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there. Yet. And it’s taking too long. I'd see him a couple times a year and we'd always spent time together and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit, and we'd cross paths now and again. We'd always spend time together. He was a hero of mine. I'd heard ""Red Hot."" I must have been only 15 or 16 when I did and it's impressed me to this day. I never grow tired of listening to it. Never got tired of watching Billy Lee perform, either. We spent time together just talking and playing into the night. He was a deep, truthful man. He wasn't bitter or nostalgic. He just accepted it. He knew where he had come from and he was content with who he was. And then one day he got sick. And like my friend John Mellencamp would sing -- because John sang some truth today -- one day you get sick and you don't get better. That's from a song of his called ""Life is Short Even on Its Longest Days."" It's one of the better songs of the last few years, actually. I ain't lying. And I ain't lying when I tell you that MusiCares paid for my friend's doctor bills, mortgage and gave him spending money. They were able to at least make his life comfortable, tolerable to the end. That is something that can't be repaid. Any organization that would do that would have to have my blessing. I'm going to get out of here now. I'm going to put an egg in my shoe and beat it. I probably left out a lot of people and said too much about some. But that's OK. Like the spiritual song, 'I'm still just crossing over Jordan too.' Let's hope we meet again. Sometime. And we will, if, like Hank Williams says, ""the good Lord willing and the creek don't rise.”"
Grand Coulee Dam,Grand Coulee Dam,Bob Dylan,"Well, the world owns seven wonders as the travellers always tell
Some gardens and some towers, I guess you know them well
But now the greatest wonder is in Uncle Sam's fair land
That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee Dam
She come up the Canadian Rockies where the crystal waters glide
Comes a-roaring down the canyon to meet that salty tide
From the great Pacific Ocean to where the sun sets in the west
That big Grand Coulee country in that land I love the best
In the misty glitter of that wild and windward spray
Men have fought the pounding waters and met a watery grave
Once she tore men's boats to splinters but she gave men dreams to dream
That day that Grand Coulee dam went across that wild and restless stream
Oh, Uncle Sam took up the notion in the year of thirty three
For the factory and the farmer and for all of you and me
He said: roll it on Columbia, you can roll out to the sea
But river, while you're rolling you can do some work for me
Now from Washington and Oregon you can hear them factories a-hum
Making corn and making manganese and light aluminum
Always a flying fortress to blast for Uncle Sam
That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee dam
Well, the world owns seven wonders as the travellers always tell
Some gardens and some towers, I guess you know them well
But now the greatest wonder is in Uncle Sam's fair land
That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee Dam"
Guess I’m Doing Fine,Guess I'm Doing Fine,Bob Dylan,"Well, I ain’t got my childhood
Or friends I once did know
No, I ain’t got my childhood

I can take it anywhere I go
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing fine

And I’ve never had much money
But I’m still around somehow
No, I’ve never had much money
But I’m still around somehow
Many times I’ve bended
But I ain’t never yet bowed
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing fine

Trouble, oh trouble
I’ve trouble on my mind
Trouble, oh trouble
Trouble on my mind
But the trouble in the world, Lord
Is much more bigger than mine
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing fine
And I never had no armies
To jump at my command
No, I ain’t got no armies
To jump at my command
But I don’t need no armies
I got me one good friend
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing fine

I been kicked and whipped and trampled on
I been shot at just like you
I been kicked and whipped and trampled on
I been shot at just like you
But as long as the world keeps a-turning
I just keep a-turnin’ too
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing’ fine

Well, my road might be rocky
The stones might cut my face
My road it might be rocky
The stones might cut my face
But as some folks ain’t got no road at all
They gotta stand in the same old place
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing fine"
Guess Things Happen That Way,Guess Things Happen That Way (Ft. Johnny Cash),Bob Dylan,"Well, you asked me if I'll forget my baby
I guess I will, someday
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
You asked me if I'll get along
I guess I will, someway
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
God gave me that girl to lean on
Then he put me on my own
Heaven, help me be a man and
Have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
You asked me if I'll miss her kisses
I guess I will, everyday
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
You asked me if I'll find another
I don't know; I can't say
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way

You got the crazy rhythm when you walk
You make me nervous when you start to talk

Standing on the highway, you flag me down
Said, take me Daddy, to the nearest town

Late last night you come a-rolling across my mind
The joint is jumping
It’s really something
The beat is pumping
My heart is thumping
Spent my money on you honey
My limbs are shaking
My mind is breaking

You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop
You make me so mad, I tell you to stop

I had a dream about you, baby
Had a dream about you, baby
Late last night you come a-rolling across my mind

You wear a blue scarf upon your head
Wearing a long dress fire engine red

You gave me your right hand?
You said whenever you'd marry
I would be the man
But you broke your promise
Go with whom you please
My poor heart is aching
You are at your ease
I went to church last Sunday
Molly came ridin' by
I could tell her mind was changin'
By the rovin' of her eye

Hard Times,Hard Times (Ft. Willie Nelson),Bob Dylan,"Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times, come again no more
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times, come again no more
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more
There's pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day
Oh, hard times, come again no more
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door

Hang your stockings, say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane
He's got a bag that is filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
So jump in bed, cover your head
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He doesn't care if you're rich or poor
For he loves you just the same
Santa Claus knows that we're God's children
That makes everything right
Fill your hearts with the Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He'll come around when the chimes ring out
When it's Christmas morn again
Peace on earth will come to all
If we just follow the light
Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Clause comes tonight

Peace on earth will come to all
If we just follow the light
Let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Clause comes tonight
'Cause Santa Clause comes tonight
Let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Clause comes tonight
Tonight, tonight"
Here’s That Rainy Day,Here's That Rainy Day,Bob Dylan,"Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams
Funny but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought
That it might turn out this way
Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my love so near
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny that rainy day is here
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny that rainy day is here"
Hero Blues,Hero Blues,Bob Dylan,"Yes, the gal I got
I swear she’s the screaming end
She wants me to be a hero
So she can tell all her friends

Well, she begged, she cried
She pleaded with me all last night
Well, she begged, she cried
She pleaded with me all last night
She wants me to go out
And find somebody to fight

She reads too many books
She got new movies inside her head
She reads too many books
She got movies inside her head
She wants me to walk out running
She wants me to crawl back dead

You need a different kinda man, babe
One that can grab and hold your heart
Need a different kind of man, babe
One that can hold and grab your heart
You need a different kind of man, babe
You need Napoleon Boneeparte
Well, when I’m dead
No more good times will I crave
When I’m dead
No more good times will I crave
You can stand and shout hero
All over my lonesome grave"
He’s Funny That Way,He's Funny That Way,Bob Dylan,"Once he dressed in silks and lace
And owned a Rolls Royce car
Now he seems quite out of place
Like a fallen star
Race around my kitchen sink
Happy as can be
I'll just have to stop and think
Why he fell for me

I'm not much to look at
Nothing to see
Just glad I'm living
And lucky to be
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way
I can't save a dollar
Ain't worth a cent
He'd never hollar
He'd live in a tent
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way
Though he'd love to work
And slave for me everyday
He'd be so much better off
If I went away

But why should I leave him?
Why should I go?
He'd be unhappy without me, I know
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

I can see no other way
And no better plan
Than to end it all and let him go
To some other man
When I hurt his feelings once in a while
His only answer is one little smile
I got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way"
Hiding Too Long,Hiding Too Long,Bob Dylan,"Come you phoney super patriotic people that say
That hatin' and fearing is my only way
That this here country has got to be
You're thinkin' of yourselves, you ain't thinkin' of me
You're not thinkin' of any George Washington
You're not thinkin' of any Thomas Jefferson
But you say that you are and you lie and mislead
You use their names for aims, for your selfish greed
Don't speak to me of your patriotism
When you throw the Southern black boy in prison
An' you say that the only good niggers are the ones that have died
Don't think I'll ever stand on your side
Though you make it so hard for me to love
My face will never feel the slap of your glove
My cards will never buy..
My hands will never buy the cards that you play
My feet will never walk down the road that you lay
Get out in the open, stop standin' afar
Let the whole world see what a hypocrit you are
I ain't jokin' and it ain't no gag
You bin hidin' too long behind the American flag"
High Water (For Charley Patton),High Water (For Charley Patton),Bob Dylan,"High water risin'
Risin' night and day
All the gold and silver
Are being stolen away
Big Joe Turner lookin' East and West
From the dark room of his mind
He made it to Kansas City
Twelfth Street and Vine
Nothing standing there
High water everywhere
High water risin'
The shacks are slidin' down
Folks lose their possessions
Folks are leaving town
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it
Then she hung it on a wall
Says, ""You're dancin' with whom they tell you to
Or you don't dance at all.""
It's tough out there
High water everywhere
I got a cravin' love for blazing speed
Got a hopped up Mustang Ford
Jump into the wagon, love
Throw your panties overboard
I can write you poems
Make a strong man lose his mind
I'm no pig without a wig
I hope you treat me kind
Things are breakin' up out there
High water everywhere
High water risin'
Six inches 'bove my head
Coffins droppin' in the street
Like balloons made out of lead
Water pourin' into Vicksburg
Don't know what I'm going to do
""Don't reach out for me,"" she said
""Can't you see I'm drownin' too?""
It's rough out there
High water everywhere
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman
The Italian and the Jew
""You can't open your mind, boys
To every conceivable point of view.""
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five
Judge says to the High Sheriff
""I want him dead or alive
Either one, I don't care.""
High Water everywhere
The Cuckoo is a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
I'm preachin' the Word of God
I'm puttin' out your eyes
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat
She said, ""Take it off the shelf
As great as you are, man
You'll never be greater than yourself.""
I told her I didn't really care
High water everywhere
I'm getting' up in the morning
I believe I'll dust my broom
Keeping away from the women
I'm givin' 'em lots of room
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale
Everything is looking blue
I just can't be happy, love
Unless you're happy too
It's bad out there
High water everywhere"
Highlands,Highlands,Bob Dylan,"Well my heart’s in the Highlands gentle and fair
Honeysuckle blooming in the Wildwood air
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow
Well my heart’s in the Highland
I’m gonna go there when I feel good enough to go

Windows were shaking’ all night in my dreams
Everything was exactly the way that it seems
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page
Same ol’ rat race
Life in the same ol’ cage

I don’t want nothing from anyone, ain’t that much to take
Wouldn’t know the difference between a real blonde and a fake
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery
I wish someone would come
And push back the clock for me

Well my heart’s in the Highlands wherever I roam
That’s where I’ll be when I get called home
The wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme
Well my heart’s in the Highland
I can only get there one step at a time
I’m listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound
Someone’s always yelling turn it down
Feel like I’m drifting
Drifting from scene to scene
I’m wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?

Insanity is smashing up against my soul
You can say I was on anything but a roll
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top
What would I do with it anyway
Maybe take it to the pawn shop

My heart’s in the Highlands at the break of dawn
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan
Big white clouds like chariots that swing down low
Well my heart’s in the Highlands
Only place left to go

I’m in Boston town, in some restaurant
I got no idea what I want
Well, maybe I do but I’m just really not sure
Waitress comes over
Nobody in the place but me and her
It must be a holiday, there’s nobody around
She studies me closely as I sit down
She got a pretty face and long white shiny legs
She says, “What’ll it be?”
I say, “I don’t know, you got any soft boiled eggs?”

She looks at me, says, “I’d bring you some
But we’re out of ’m, you picked the wrong time to come”
Then she says, “I know you’re an artist, draw a picture of me!”
I say, “I would if I could, but
I don’t do sketches from memory”

“Well,” she says, “I’m right here in front of you, or haven’t you looked?”
I say, “All right, I know, but I don’t have my drawing book!”
She gives me a napkin, she says, “You can do it on that”
I say, “Yes I could, but
I don’t know where my pencil is at!”

She pulls one out from behind her ear
She says, “All right now, go ahead, draw me, I’m standing right here”
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see
Well she takes the napkin and throws it back
And says, “That don’t look a thing like me!”
I said, “Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does”
She says, “You must be joking’.” I say, “I wish I was!”
Then she says, “You don’t read women authors, do you?”
Least that’s what I think I hear her say
“Well,” I say, “how would you know and what would it matter anyway?”

“Well,” she says, “you just don’t seem like you do!”
I said, “You’re way wrong”
She says, “Which ones have you read then?” I say, “I read Erica Jong!”
She goes away for a minute
And I slide up out of my chair
I step outside back to the busy street but nobody’s going anywhere

Well my heart’s in the Highlands with the horses and hounds
Way up in the border country, far from the towns
With the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow
My heart’s in the Highlands
Can’t see any other way to go

Every day is the same thing out the door
Feel further away than ever before
Some things in life, it gets too late to learn
Well, I’m lost somewhere
I must have made a few bad turns

I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes
They’re drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes
All the young men with their young women looking so good
Well, I’d trade places with any of them
In a minute, if I could

I’m crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog
Talking to myself in a monologue
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat
Somebody just asked me
If I registered to vote

The sun is beginning to shine on me
But it’s not like the sun that used to be
The party’s over and there’s less and less to say
I got new eyes
Everything looks far away

Well, my heart’s in the Highlands at the break of day
Over the hills and far away
There’s a way to get there and I’ll figure it out somehow
But I’m already there in my mind
And that’s good enough for now"
Highway 51,Highway 51,Bob Dylan,"Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
If I don't get the girl I'm loving
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more

Well, I know that highway like I know my hand
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land
Well, if I should die before my time should come
And if I should die before my time should come
Won't you bury my body out on the Highway 51"
Highway 61 Revisited,Highway 61 Revisited,Bob Dylan,"Oh God said to Abraham, “Kill me a son”
Abe said, “Man, you must be puttin' me on”
God say, “No.”
Abe say, “What?”
God say, “You can do what you want, Abe, but
The next time you see me comin' you better run”
Well Abe says, “Where you want this killin' done?”
God says, “Out on Highway 61”
Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department they wouldn’t give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard where can I go
Howard said there’s only one place I know
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
Old Howard just pointed with his gun
And said ""That way, down Highway 61""
Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
I got forty red, white and blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don’t ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?
And Louie the King said ""Let me think for a minute son""
And he said ""Yes, I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61""
Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren’t right
""My complexion"" she says ""is much too white""
He said ""Come here and step into the light""
He says ""Hmm you’re right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done""
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61
Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored
Tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said ""I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes I think it can be very easily done
We’ll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61"""

Honest with Me,Honest with Me,Bob Dylan,"Well, I’m stranded in the city that never sleeps
Some of these women they just give me the creeps
I’m avoidin’ the Southside the best I can
These memories I got, they can strangle a man
Well I came ashore in the dead of the night
Lot of things can get in the way when you’re tryin’ to do what’s right
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
You’d be honest with me if only you knew
I’m not sorry for nothin’ I’ve done
I’m glad I fought—I only wish we’d won
The Siamese twins are comin’ to town
People can’t wait—they’re gathered around
When I left my home the sky split open wide
I never wanted to go back there—I’d rather have died
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
You’d be honest with me if only you knew
My woman got a face like a teddy bear
She’s tossin’ a baseball bat in the air
The meat is so tough you can’t cut it with a sword
I’m crashin’ my car, trunk first into the boards
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice
Well, I’ll sell it to ya at a reduced price
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
You’d be honest with me, if only you knew
Some things are too terrible to be true
I won’t come here no more if it bothers you
The Southern Pacific leaving me at nine forty-five
I’m having a hard time believin’ some people were ever alive
I’m stark naked, but I don’t care
I’m going off into the woods, I’m huntin’ bare
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
Well, you’d be honest with me if only you knew
I’m here to create the new imperial empire
I’m going to do whatever circumstances require
I care so much for you—didn’t think that I could
I can’t tell my heart that you’re no good

And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you

House Carpenter,House Carpenter,Bob Dylan,"Well met, well met, my own true love
Well met, well met, cried she
I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
And it's all for the love of thee

I could have married a King's daughter there
She would have married me
But I have forsaken my King's daughter there
It's all for the love of thee

Well, if you could have married a King's daughter there
I'm sure you're the one to blame
For I am married to a house carpenter
And I'm sure he's a fine young man

Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
And come away with me
I'll take you where the green grass grows
On the shores of sunny Italy

So up she picked her babies three
And gave them kisses, one, two, three
Saying ""take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
And keep him good company.""
Well, they were sailing about two weeks
I'm sure it was not three
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck
Saying she wants company

""Well, are you weeping for your house and home?
Or are you weeping for your babies three?""
""Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter
I'm weeping for my babies three.""

Oh what are those hills yonder, my love
They look as white as snow
Those are the hill of heaven, my love
You and I'll never know

Oh what are those hills yonder, my love
They look as dark as night
Those are the hills of hellfire my love
Where you and I will unite

Oh twice around went the gallant ship
I'm sure it was not three
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea"

Is when he's on a drunk

He fills his glasses up to the brim
And he'll pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life
Is ramblin' from town to town

Oh, tell my baby sister
Not to do what I have done!
But shun that house in New Orleans

How Deep Is the Ocean?,How Deep Is the Ocean?,Bob Dylan,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?
How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

Huck’s Tune,Huck's Tune,Bob Dylan,"Well I wandered alone through a desert of stone
And I dreamt of my future wife
My sword's in my hand and I'm next in command
In this version of death called life
My plate and my cup are right straight up
I took a rose from the hand of a child
When I kiss your lips, the honey drips
But I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

Every day we meet on any old street
And you're in your girlish prime
The short and the tall are coming to the ball
I go there all the time
Behind every tree, there's something to see
The river is wider than a mile
I tried you twice, you can't be nice
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

Here come the nurse with money in her purse
Here come the ladies and men
You push it all in and you've no chance to win
You play 'em on down to the end
I'm laying in the sand getting a sunshine tan
Moving along riding in style
From my toes to my head, you knock me dead
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while
I count the years and I shed no tears
I'm blinded to what might have been
Nature's voice makes my heart rejoice
Play me the wild song of the wind
I found hopeless love in the room above
When the sun and the weather were mild
You're as fine as wine, I ain't handing you no line
But I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

All the merry little elves can go hang themselves
My faith is as cold as can be
I'm stacked high to the roof and I'm not without proof
If you don't believe me, come see
You think I'm blue, I think so too
In my words, you'll find no guile
The game's gotten old, the deck's gone cold
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

The game's gotten old, the deck's gone cold
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while"
Hurricane,Hurricane,Bob Dylan,"Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!”

Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Three bodies lyin' there
Does Patty see
And another man named Bello
Moving around mysteriously
“I didn’t do it,” he says
And he throws up his hands
“I was only robbin' the register
I hope you understand

I saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops
“One of us had better call up the cops”
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that’s just the way things go
If you’re black
You might as well not show up on the street
Unless you want to draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around
He said, “I saw two men running out
They looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”

And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
They take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
Says, “Why did you bring him in here for?
He ain't the guy!”

Here’s the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin’s in South America, fighting for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame

“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw
Running that night?”
“Don’t forget that you are white”
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”
The cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job
And we’re talking to your friend Bello
Now you don’t want to have to go back to jail
Be a nice fellow

You’ll be doing society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder
On him
He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
""It’s my work"", he’d say, ""and I do it for pay
And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way""

Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man
Into a mouse

All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus
He never had a chance
The judge made Rubin’s witnesses
Drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched
He was a revolutionary bum

And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one
Who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder “one,”
Guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride

How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed
To live in a land
Where justice is a game

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink Martinis
And watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha
In a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell

Yes that’s the story of the Hurricane
But it won’t be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he’s done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world"
I Ain’t Got No Home,I Ain't Got No Home,Bob Dylan,"Well, I ain't got no home I'm just ramblin' round
Just a ramblin' worker, go from town to town
Police make it hard wherever I may go
I ain't got no home in this world anymore
All my brothers and my sisters have stranded on this road
That's a hard ol' dusty road that a million feet have trod
Rich men took our home and they drove us from our door
Man can't feel at home in this world anymore
Well, as I look around me it's funny and plain to see
This wicked cruel world is a funny ol' place to be
The gamblin' man is rich lord, the workin' man is poor
Can't fit his home in this world anymore"
I Am a Lonesome Hobo,I Am a Lonesome Hobo,Bob Dylan,"I am a lonesome hobo
Without family or friends
Where another man’s life might begin
That’s exactly where mine ends
I have tried my hand at bribery
Blackmail and deceit
And I’ve served time for everything
’Cept beggin' on the street

Well, once I was rather prosperous
There was nothing I did lack
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth
And silk upon my back
But I did not trust my brother
I carried him to blame
Which led me to my fatal doom
To wander off in shame

Kind ladies and kind gentlemen
Soon I will be gone
But let me just warn you all
Before I do pass on
Stay free from petty jealousies
Live by no man’s code
And hold your judgment for yourself
Lest you wind up on this road"
I Believe in You,I Believe in You,Bob Dylan,"They ask me how I feel
And if my love is real
And how I know I'll make it through
And they, they look at me and frown
They'd like to drive me from this town
They don't want me around
Because I believe in you

They, they show me to the door
They say, ""Don't come back no more""
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
And I, I walk out on my own
A thousand miles from home
But I don't feel alone
Because I believe in you

I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter
L believe in you even though we be apart
I believe in you even on the morning after
Oh, when the dawn is nearing
Oh, when the night is disappearing
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart
Don't let me drift too far
Keep me where you are
Where I will always be renewed
And that which you've given me today
Is worth more than I could pay
And no matter what they say
I believe in you

L believe in you when winter turns to summer
I believe in you when white turn to black
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered
Oh, though the earth may shake me
Oh, though my friends forsake me
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back

Don't let me change my heart
Keep me set apart
From all the plans they do pursue
And I, I don't mind the pain
Don't mind the driving rain
I know I will sustain
Because I believe in you"
I Can’t Come In with a Broken Heart,I Can't Come In with a Broken Heart,Bob Dylan,"Well i go get broke down, before i bust down
Gotta get in without a broken heart well
Get a hoe down before a low down
Before my guilt is acid hot
Well every single morning
I can't take it no more
Well if you with a heartache
Go down baby
She don't care about that us apart
Well she gonna have 'em, but she won't invite me
But i can't come in with a broken heart
I hold down, can't come down
Is comin' in without a broken heart
Well you cheated, showed her down
But i don't come around
O when she'll take ya tear us apart"
I Can’t Get You Off Of My Mind,I Can't Get You Off Of My Mind,Bob Dylan,"Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time
Lord, I've tried and I've tried, all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind
And you think you would leave me behind
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind
Do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart
When I can't get you off of my mind?
Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time
Lord, I've tried and I've tried, all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind
You believe that a true love is blind
So you fool every new love you find
You've got stars in your eyes but they can't hide the lies
Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
But I can't get you off of my mind
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time
Lord, I've tried and I've tried, all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind"
I Contain Multitudes,I Contain Multitudes,Bob Dylan,"Today, and tomorrow, and yesterday, too
The flowers are dyin' like all things do
Follow me close,?I’m?going to Bally-na-Lee
I'll?lose my mind if you don't?come with me
I fuss with my hair, and I fight blood feuds
I contain multitudes
Got a tell-tale heart like Mr. Poe
Got skeletons in the walls of people you know
I’ll drink to the truth and the things we said
I'll drink to the man that shares your bed
I paint landscapes, and I paint nudes
I contain multitudes
A red Cadillac and a black mustache
Rings on my fingers that sparkle and flash
Tell me, what's next? What shall we do?
Half my soul, baby, belongs to you
I rollick and I frolic with all the young dudes
I contain multitudes
I'm just like Anne Frank, like Indiana Jones
And them British bad boys, the Rolling Stones
I go right to the edge, I go right to the end
I go right where all things lost are made good again
I sing the songs of experience like William Blake
I have no apologies to make
Everything's flowing all at the same time
I live on a boulevard of crime
I drive fast cars, and I eat fast foods
I contain multitudes
Pink pedal-pushers, red blue jeans
All the pretty maids, and all the old queens
All the old queens from all my past lives
I carry four pistols and two large knives
I'm a man of contradictions, I'm a man of many moods
I contain multitudes
You greedy old wolf, I'll show you my heart
But not all of it, only the hateful parts
I’ll sell you down the river, I’ll put a price on your head
What more can I tell you? I sleep with life and death in the same bed
Get lost, madame, get up off my knee
Keep your mouth away from me
I'll keep the path open, the path in my mind
I’ll see to it that there's no love left behind
I'll play Beethoven's sonatas, Chopin’s preludes
I contain multitudes"
I Could Have Told You,I Could Have Told You,Bob Dylan,"I could have told you
She'd hurt you
She'd you love you a while
Then desert you
If only you asked
I could have told you so

I could have saved you
Some crying
Yes, I could have told you she's lying
But you were in love
And didn't want to know

I hear her now
As I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now
Making promises she'll never keep
And soon, it's over and done with
She'll find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears
I could have told you so

I hear her now
As I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now
Making promises she'll never keep
And soon, it's over and done with
She'll find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears
I could have told you so"
I Couldn’t Sleep a Wink Last Night,I Couldn't Sleep a Wink Last Night,Bob Dylan,"I couldn't sleep a wink last night
Because we had that silly fight
I thought my heart would break the whole night through
I knew that you'd be sorry
And I'm sorry too
I didn't have my favorite dream
The one in which I hold you tight
I had to call you up this morning
To see if everything was still all right
Yes, I had to call you up this morning
'Cause I couldn't sleep a wink last night
I didn't have my favorite dream
The one in which I hold you tight
I had to call you up this morning
To see if everything was still all right

Cause I couldn't sleep a wink last night"
I Don’t Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met),I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met),Bob Dylan,"I can't understand
She let go of my hand
And left me here facing the wall
I’d sure like to know
Why she'd go
But I can't get close to her at all
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
She said she would never forget
But now morning’s clear
It’s like I ain't here
She acts like we never met

It’s all new to me
Like some mystery
It could even be like a myth
But it’s hard to think on
That she’s the same one
That last night I was with
From darkness, dreams are deserted
Am I still dreaming yet?
I wish she’d unlock
Her voice once and talk
'Stead of actin' like we never have met
If she ain't feelin' well
Then why don’t she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?
Without any doubt
She seems too far out
For me to return to or chase
Well her skirt it swayed
As the guitar played
Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed
For she ain't the same
She just acts like we never have met

If I didn’t have to guess
I’d gladly confess
To anything I might’ve tried
If I was with her too long
Or have done something wrong
I'd wish she’d tell me what it is, I’ll run and hide
Though the night ran swirling and whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she don’t
Evidently she won’t
She just acts like we never have met
I’m leavin' today
I’ll be on my way
Of this I can't say very much
But if you want me to
I can be just like you
And pretend that we never have touched
And if anybody asks me
“Is it easy to forget?”
I’ll say, “It’s easily done
You just pick anyone
And pretend that you never have met!”"
I Don’t Hurt Anymore,I Don't Hurt Anymore,Bob Dylan,"I don't hurt anymore;
All my teardrops are dry
No more walking the floor
With that burning inside
Just to think it could be;
Time has opened the door
And at last I am free
I don't hurt anymore
Oh, you still deny
I wanted to die
The day taht you said we were through
But now that I find
You're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true
I forgot it somehow
That I cancelled before
And it's wonderful now
I don't hurt anymore
No use to deny
I wanted to die
The day that you said we were through
But now that I find
You're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true
I forgot it somehow
That I cancelled before
And it's wonderful now
I don't hurt anymore"
I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine,I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine,Bob Dylan,"I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
Alive as you or me
Tearing through these quarters
In the utmost misery
With a blanket underneath his arm
And a coat of solid gold
Searching for the very souls
Whom already have been sold

“Arise, arise,” he cried so loud
With a voice without restraint
“Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
And hear my sad complaint
No martyr is among ye now
Whom you can call your own
But go on your way accordingly
But know you’re not alone”

I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
Alive with fiery breath
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones
That put him out to death
Oh, I awoke in anger
So alone and terrified
I put my fingers against the glass
And bowed my head and cried"
I Feel a Change Comin’ On,I Feel a Change Comin’ On,Bob Dylan,"Well I'm looking the world over
Looking far off into the East
And I see my baby coming
She's walking with the village priest
I feel a change coming on
And the last part of the day is already gone

We got so much in common
We strive for the same old ends
And I just can't wait
Wait for us to become friends
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day is already gone

Life is for love
And they say that love is blind
If you want to live easy
Baby pack your clothes with mine
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day is already gone

Well now what's the use in dreaming
You got better things to do
Dreams never did work for me anyway
Even when they did come true
You are as whorish as ever
Baby you could start a fire
I must be losing my mind
You're the object of my desire
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day is already gone

I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver
And I'm reading James Joyce
Some people they tell me
I got the blood of the land in my voice

Everybody got all the money
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes
Everybody got all the flowers
I don't have one single rose
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day is already gone"
I Forgot More Than You’ll Ever Know,I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know,Bob Dylan,"I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

You think you know the smile on her lips
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

You think you'll find heaven of bliss
In each caress, in each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

You stole her love from me one day
You didn't care how it hurt me
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be

You think she's yours, to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her"
I Forgot to Remember to Forget,I Forgot to Remember to Forget,Bob Dylan,"I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time
The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we ever met
But something sure is wrong
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we ever met
Well, but something sure is wrong
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget"
I Guess I’ll Have to Change My Plans,I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plans,Bob Dylan,"I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized there'd be another man
I overlooked that point completely
Until the big affair began
Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air
My feet are back upon the ground
I lost the one girl I'd found
Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air
My feet are back upon the ground
I lost the one girl
The one girl I'd found
My boiling point is much too low
For me to try to be a fly Lothario"
I Pity the Poor Immigrant,I Pity the Poor Immigrant,Bob Dylan,"I pity the poor immigrant
Who wishes he would’ve stayed home
Who uses all his power to do evil
But in the end is always left so alone
That man whom with his fingers cheats
And who lies with every breath
Who passionately hates his life
And likewise, fears his death

I pity the poor immigrant
Whose strength is spent in vain
Whose heaven is like Ironsides
Whose tears are like rain
Who eats but is not satisfied
Who hears but does not see
Who falls in love with wealth itself
And turns his back on me

I pity the poor immigrant
Who tramples through the mud
Who fills his mouth with laughing
And who builds his town with blood
Whose visions in the final end
Must shatter like the glass
I pity the poor immigrant
When his gladness comes to pass"
I Shall Be Free,I Shall Be Free,Bob Dylan,"Well, I took me a woman late last night
I’s three-fourths drunk, she looked alright
'Til she started peeling off her onion gook
Took off her wig, said, “How do I look?""
I's high flying, bare-naked
Out the window

Well, sometimes I might get drunk
Walk like a duck and smell like a skunk
Don’t hurt me none, it don’t hurt my pride
Because I got my little lady right by my side
She's a tryin to hide, pretendin' she don't know me

I’s out there painting on the old woodshed
When a can of black paint, it fell on my head
I went down to scrub and rub
But I had to sit in back of the tub
Cost a quarter
Half price

Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop
It’s President Kennedy calling me up
He said, “My friend, Bob
What do we need to make the country grow?”
I said, “My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot
Anita Ekberg
Sophia Loren”
Country'll grow
Well, I got a woman, five feet short
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head
Rolls me over and kicks me out of bed
She’s a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser

Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time
I got a woman who works herself blind
Works up to her britches, up to her neck
Writes me letters and sends me checks
She’s a humdinger
Folk singer

Late one day in the middle of the week
Eyes were closed, I was half asleep
I chased me a woman up the hill
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill
I jumped a fallout shelter
I jumped a string bean
I jumped a TV dinner
I jumped a shotgun

Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote
He’s a-running for office on the ballot note
He’s out there preaching in front of the steeple
Telling me he loves all kinds of people
He’s eatin' bagels
He’s eatin' pizza
He’s eatin' chitlins
Oh, set me down on a television floor
I’ll flip the channel to number four
Out of the shower comes a football man
With a bottle of oil in his hand
Greasy kid stuff
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is
What do you do about Willy Mays
Martin Luther King
Olatunji

Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean
She takes about fifteen baths a day
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face
She’s insane

Well, they ask me why I’m drunk all the time
It levels my head and eases my mind
I just walk along and stroll and sing
I see better days and I do better things
I catch dinosaurs
Make love to Elizabeth Taylor
Catch hell from Richard Burton"
I Shall Be Released,I Shall Be Released,Bob Dylan,"They say every man must need protection
They say every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above the wall
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
There's a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him cry so loud
Calling out that he's been framed
Yeah
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released"
I Still Miss Someone,I Still Miss Someone (Ft. Johnny Cash),Bob Dylan,"At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind has come
Sweethearts walk by together
And?I?still miss someone
I?go out on a party
And look?for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Because I still miss someone
Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
And I still miss someone"
I Threw It All Away,I Threw It All Away,Bob Dylan,"I once held her
In my arms
She said she would
Always stay
But I was cruel
I treated her like a fool
I threw it all away

Once I had mountains
In the palm of my hand
And rivers that ran through
Every day
But I must have been mad
I never knew what I had
Until I threw it all away

Love is all there is
It makes the world go ’round
Love and only love
It can’t be denied
No matter what you think about it
You just won’t be able to do without it
Take a tip from one who’s tried
So if you find someone
Who gives you all of her love
Take it to your heart, don’t let it stray
For one thing for certain
You will surely be a-hurtin'
If you throw it all away
If you throw it all away"
I Walk the Line,I Walk the Line (Ft. Johnny Cash),Bob Dylan,"I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open?all?the time
I keep?the ends out for the tie?that binds
Because you're mine
I walk the line
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine
I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine
I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine
I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine
I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine
I walk the line
Because you're mine
I walk the line
Because you're mine
I walk the line
Because you're mine
I walk the line"
I Wanna Be Your Lover,I Wanna Be Your Lover,Bob Dylan,"Well, the rainman comes with his magic wand
And the judge says, “Mona can’t have no bond”
And the walls collide, Mona cries
And the rainman leaves in the Wolfman’s disguise

I want to be your lover, baby, I want to be your man
I want to be your lover, baby
I don’t want to be hers, I want to be yours

Well, the undertaker in his midnight suit
Says to the masked man, “Ain’t you cute!”
Well, the mask man he gets up on the shelf
And he says, “You ain’t so bad yourself”


Well, jumping Judy can’t go no higher
She had bullets in her eyes, and they fire
Rasputin he’s so dignified
He touched the back of her head an’ he died

Well, Phaedra with her looking glass
Stretching out upon the grass
She gets all messed up and she faints
That’s ’cause she’s so obvious and you ain’t"
I Want You,I Want You,Bob Dylan,"The guilty undertaker sighs
The lonesome organ grinder cries
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn
But it’s not that way
I wasn’t born to lose you
I want you, I want you
I want you, so bad
Honey, I want you

The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinking from my broken cup
And ask me to
Open up the gate for you

I want you, I want you
Yes I want you, so bad
Honey, I want you
How my fathers, they’ve gone down
True love they’ve been without it
But all their daughters put me down
'Cause I don’t think about it

Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
And talk with my chambermaid
She knows that I’m not afraid to look at her
She is good to me
And there’s nothing she doesn’t see
She knows where I’d like to be
But it doesn’t matter

I want you, I want you
Yes I want you, so bad
Honey, I want you

Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit
He spoke to me, I took his flute
No, I wasn’t very cute to him, was I?
But I did it, because he lied
And because he took you for a ride
Uh because time was on his side
And because I
I want you, I want you
Yes I want you, so bad
Honey, I want you"
I Was Young When I Left Home,I Was Young When I Left Home,Bob Dylan,"I was young when I left home
But I been out a-rambling around
And I never wrote a letter to my home
To my home, Lord, to my home
And I never wrote a letter to my home

It was just the other day
I was bringing home my pay
When I met an old friend I used to know

Said your mother’s dead and gone
Baby sister’s all gone wrong
And your daddy needs you home right away

Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny on my name
Well I can’t go home Thisaway
Thisaway, Lord, Lord, Lord
And I can’t go home Thisaway

If you miss the train I’m on
Count the days I’m gone
You will hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, honey baby. Lord Lord Lord
And you’ll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
I’m playing on a track
Ma would come and whoop me back
On them trestles down by old Jim McKay’s

When I pay the debt I owe
To the commissary store
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home
Go home, Lord Lord Lord
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home

Used to tell Ma sometimes
When I see them riding blinds
Going to make me a home out in the wind
In the wind, Lord in the wind
Make me a home out in the wind

I don’t like it in the wind
Want to go back home again
But I can’t go home Thisaway
Thisaway, Lord Lord Lord
And I can’t go home Thisaway"
I and I,I and I,Bob Dylan,"Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams

I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Think I’ll go out and go for a walk
Not much happening here, nothing ever does
Besides, if she wakes up now, she’ll just want me to talk
I got nothing to say, specially about whatever was

I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don’t win the race
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice’s beautiful face
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Outside of two men on a train platform there’s nobody in sight
They’re waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track
The world could come to an end tonight, but that’s all right
She should still be there sleepin’ when I get back

I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Noontime, and I’m still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part
Into the narrow lanes, I can’t stumble or stay put
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I’m listening only to my heart
I’ve made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot

I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives"
Idiot Wind,Idiot Wind,Bob Dylan,"Someone’s got it in for me
They’re planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish they’d cut it out quick
But when they will I can only guess
They say I shot a man named Gray
And took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can’t help it if I’m lucky

People see me all the time
And they just can’t remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas
Images and distorted facts
Even you, yesterday
You had to ask me where it was at
I couldn’t believe after all these years
You didn’t know me any better than that
Sweet lady

Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your mouth
Blowing down the backroads heading south
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe
I ran into the fortune-teller
Who said beware of lightning that might strike
I haven’t known peace and quiet
For so long, I can’t remember what it’s like
There’s a lone soldier on the cross
Smoke pouring out of a boxcar door
You didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done
In the final end he won the war
After losing every battle

I woke up on the roadside
Daydreaming about the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare
Shoot through my head and are making me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best
And cover up the truth with lies
One day you’ll be in the ditch
Flies buzzing around your eyes
Blood on your saddle

Idiot wind
Blowing through the flowers on your tomb
Blowing through the curtains in your room
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe
It was gravity which pulled us down
And destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage
But it just wasn’t enough to change my heart
Now everything’s a little upside down
As a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped
What’s good is bad, what’s bad is good
You’ll find out when you reach the top
You’re on the bottom

I noticed at the ceremony
Your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can’t remember your face anymore
Your mouth has changed, your eyes don’t look into mine
The priest wore black on the seventh day
And sat stone-faced while the building burned
I waited for you on the running boards
Near the cypress trees, while the springtime turned
Slowly into Autumn

Idiot wind
Blowing like a circle around my skull
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe
I can’t feel you anymore
I can’t even touch the books you’ve read
Every time I crawl past your door
I been wishing I've been somebody else instead
Down the highway, down the tracks
Down the road to ecstasy
I followed you beneath the stars
Hounded by your memory
And all your raging glory

I been double-crossed now
For the very last time and now I’m finally free
I kissed goodbye the howling beast
On the borderline which separated you from me
You’ll never know the hurt I suffered
Nor the pain I rise above
And I’ll never know the same about you
Your holiness or your kind of love
And it makes me feel so sorry

Idiot wind
Blowing through the buttons of our coats
Blowing through the letters that we wrote
Idiot wind
Blowing through the dust upon our shelves
We’re idiots, babe
It’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves"
If Dogs Run Free,If Dogs Run Free,Bob Dylan,"If dogs run free, then why not we
Across the swooping plain?
My ears hear a symphony
Of two mules, trains and rain
The best is always yet to come
That’s what they explain to me
Just do your thing, you’ll be king
If dogs run free

If dogs run free, why not me
Across the swamp of time?
My mind weaves a symphony
And tapestry of rhyme
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee
So it may flow and be
To each his own, it’s all unknown
If dogs run free

If dogs run free, then what must be
Must be, and that is all
True love can make a blade of grass
Stand up straight and tall
In harmony with the cosmic sea
True love needs no company
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole
If dogs run free"
If Not for You,If Not for You,Bob Dylan,"If not for you
Babe, I couldn’t find the door
Couldn’t even see the floor
I’d be sad and blue
If not for you

If not for you
Babe, I’d lay awake all night
Wait for the morning light
To shine in through
But it would not be new
If not for you

If not for you, my sky would fall
Rain would gather too
Without your love, I’d be nowhere at all
I’d be lost if not for you
And you know it’s true

If not for you, my sky would fall
Rain would gather too
Without your love, I’d be nowhere at all
Oh, what would I do
If not for you
If not for you
Winter would have no spring
Couldn’t hear the robin sing
I just wouldn’t have a clue
Anyway it wouldn’t ring true
If not for you
If not for you
If not for you
If not for you
If not for you"
If You Ever Go to Houston,If You Ever Go to Houston,Bob Dylan,"If you ever go to Houston
Better walk right
Keep your hands in your pockets
And your gun-belt tight
You'll be asking for trouble
If you're looking for a fight
If you ever go to Houston
Boy, you better walk right

If you're ever down there
On Bagby and Lamar
You better watch out for
The man with the shining star
Better know where you're going
Or stay where you are
If you're ever down there
On Bagby and Lamar

I know these streets
I've been here before
I nearly got killed here
During the Mexican war
Something always
Keeps me coming back for more
I know these streets
I've been here before
If you ever go to Dallas
Say hello to Mary Anne
Say I'm still pulling on the trigger
Hanging on the best I can
If you see her sister Lucy
Say I'm sorry I'm not there
Tell her other sister Betsy
To pray the sinner's prayer

I got a restless fever
Burning in my brain
Got to keep riding forward
Can't spoil the game
The same way I leave here
Will be the way that I came
Got a restless fever
Burning in my brain

Mr. Policeman
Can you help me find my girl
Last time I saw her
Was at the Magnolia Hotel
If you help me find her
You can be my pal
Mr. Policeman
Can you help me find my girl
If you ever go to Austin
Fort Worth or San Antone
Find the bar rooms I got lost in
And send my memories home
Put my tears in a bottle
Screw the top on tight
If you ever go to Houston
You better walk right"
"If You Gotta Go, Go Now","If You Gotta Go, Go Now",Bob Dylan,"Listen to me, baby
There’s something you must see
I want to be with you, gal
If you want to be with me

But if you got to go
It’s all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you got to stay all night

It am not that I’m questioning you
To take part in any quiz
It’s just that I have got no watch
And you keep asking me what time it is


I am just a poor boy, baby
Looking to connect
But I certainly don’t want you thinking
That I have not got any respect

You know I’d have nightmares
And a guilty conscience, too
If I kept you from anything
That you really wanted to do


It ain't that I’m wanting
Anything you never gave before
It’s just that I’ll be sleeping soon
It’ll be too dark for you to find the door"
"If You See Her, Say Hello","If You See Her, Say Hello",Bob Dylan,"If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
She left here last early Spring, is livin' there, I hear
Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so

We had a falling out, like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart

If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
Always have respected her for doing what she did and gettin' free
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay

I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft

Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time"
Imagination,Imagination,Bob Dylan,"Imagination is funny
It makes a cloudy day sunny
It makes a bee think of honey
Just as I think of you
Imagination is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
What to do, what to do
Have you ever felt a gentle touch
And then a kiss, and then and then
Find it's only your imagination again
Imagination is silly
You go around willy nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too"
In My Time of Dyin’,In My Time of Dyin',Bob Dylan,"Well, in my time of dying don't want nobody to mourn

Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Jesus going to make up, Jesus going to make up
Jesus going to make up my dying bed

Well, meet me Jesus, meet me, meet me
In the middle of the air
If these wings should fail me
Lord, won't you meet me with another pair
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, so I can die easy

In Search of Little Sadie,In Search of Little Sadie,Bob Dylan,"Went out last night just to take a little round
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down
I ran right home and I went to bed
With a .44 smokeless under my head
I began to think what a deed I done
I grabbed my head and I began to run
I made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Jericho
Standin’ on the corner as he's ringin' my bell
Up stepped the sheriff of Thomasville
He says, ""Young man is your name Brown?
Remember you blowed little Sadie down?""
""Oh, yes sir my name is Lee
I murdered little Sadie in first degree""
""First degree and second degree
If you got any papers, will you serve them to me.""
Well they took me downtown and they dressed me in black
They put me on a train and they sent me back
I had no one for to go my bail
They crammed me back into the county jail
Oh yes they did
Now the judge and the jury they took their stand
The judge had the papers in his right hand
Forty-one days, forty-one nights
Forty-one years with the ball and stripes, oh no
Went out last night to take a little round
I met my little Sadie and I blowed her down
I run right home and I went to bed
A .44 smokeless under my head"

Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?

The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?

Where the sun never shine
I shivered the whole night through

I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, In the pines
Where the sun never shine
I will shiver the whole night through
Little girl, Little Girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, In the pines

My Husband was a Railroad man
Killed a mile and a half from here
His head, was found, In a drivers wheel
And his body hasn't never been found

I'm going where the cold wind blows
You called me weak, and you called me the most
You called rita, bring me back home"
In the Summertime,In the Summertime,Bob Dylan,"I was in your presence for an hour or so
Or was it a day? I truly don't know
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low
By that soft and shining sea
Did you respect me for what I did
Or for what I didn't do, or for keeping it hid?
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Of everything you see?

In the summertime, ah in the summertime
In the summertime, when you were with me

I got the heart and you got the blood
We cut through iron and we cut through mud
Then came the warning that was before the flood
That set everybody free
Fools they made a mock of sin
Our loyalty they tried to win
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
When they didn't want to know or see

In the summertime, ah in the summertime
In the summertime, when you were with me
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs
Poverty and shame was theirs
But all that suffering was not to be compared
With the glory that is to be
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave
It's a part of me now, it’s been cherished and saved
It'll be with me unto the grave
And then unto eternity

In the summertime, ah in the summertime
In the summertime, when you were with me"

Isis,Isis,Bob Dylan,"I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong

I came to a high place of darkness and light
Dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down

A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away, he was not ordinary
He said “Are you looking for something easy to catch?”
Said “I got no money”
He said “That ain't necessary”

We set out that night, for the cold in the North
I gave him my blanket, and he gave me his word
I said “Where are we going?” He said we’d be back by the fourth
I said “That’s the best news that I’ve ever heard”

I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold
I was thinking about diamonds, and the world’s biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could hang on and just be her friend
I still can’t remember all the best things she said

We came to the pyramids, all embedded in ice
He said “There’s a body I’m trying to find
If I carry it out it’ll bring a good price”
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind

The wind it was a-howlin', and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night
And we chopped through the dawn
When he died I was hoping that it wasn’t contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to go on

I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I’d been had
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly
When I took up his offer I must've been mad

I picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole, and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer, then I felt satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis, just to tell her I love her
She was there in the meadow, where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep, and in need of a bed
I came in from the East, with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead

She said “Where you been?” I said “No place special”
She said “You look different” I said “Well... I guess”
She said “You been gone” I said “That’s only natural”
She said “You going to stay?” I said “If you want me to, yes""

Isis, oh, Isis, you mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain"
It Ain’t Me Babe,It Ain't Me Babe,Bob Dylan,"Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I’m not the one you want, babe
I’m not the one you need

Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door

But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe

Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I’m not the one you want, babe
I will only let you down
You say you're looking for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you and more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe

Go melt back in the night
Everything inside is made of stone
There's nothing in here moving
And anyway I'm not alone
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
A lover for your life and nothing more

But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe"

And, like starlings, flown away

Ev'ry single endless day
When your twilight nears
And one face appears
Turning winter years to May
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?
Lonely early, doesn't it?

""It was really more than lovely, wasn't it?
""Truly lovely, wasn't it?""
Strings

It Had to Be You,It Had to Be You,Bob Dylan,"Why do I do just as you say
Why must I just give you your way
Why do I sigh, why don't I try to forget
It must have been that something lovers call fate
Kept me saying, ""I have to wait""
I saw them all, just couldn't fall till we met
It had to be you, it had to be you
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue
And even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you
Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss but they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill, with all your faults I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you
For nobody else gave me a thrill, with all your faults I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you"

Now when you go home, you don't have to get along
Come back to me, baby
Where I live, that's where you belong
When things go wrong, so wrong with you

I love you baby, and you know that it's true
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby
Nothing in this world is like you
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too

It's all good

Big politician telling lies
Restaurant kitchen, all full of flies
Don't make a bit of difference, don't see why it should
But it's all right, 'cause it's all good
It's all good

Wives are leaving'their husbands, they are beginning to roam
They leave the party and they never get home

A teacup of water is enough to drown
You ought to know, if they could they would
Whatever going down, it's all good
All good
Say it's all good
People in the country, people on the land
Some of them so sick, they can hardly stand
Everybody would move away, if they could
It's hard to believe but it's all good
Yeah

The widow's cry, the orphan's plea
Everywhere you look, more misery
Come along with me, babe, I wish you would
You know what I'm saying, it's all good
All good
I said it's all good
All good

Cold-blooded killer, stalking the town
Cop cars blinking, something bad going down
Buildings are crumbling in the neighborhood
But there's nothing to worry about, because it's all good
It's all good
They say it's all good

I'll pluck off your beard and blow it in your face
This time tomorrow I'll be rolling in your place
I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
You know what they say, they say it's all good

"It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue","It's All Over Now, Baby Blue",Bob Dylan,"You must leave now
Take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun

Look out, the saints are coming through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

The sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
All your reindeer armies are all going home
Your lover who just walked out the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Leave your stepping stones behind
There's something that calls for you
Forget the dead you've left
They will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore

Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue"

There?is no sense in trying
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool’s gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
That he not busy being born is busy dying
Temptation’s page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover that you’d just be one more
Person crying
So don’t fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It’s alright, Ma, I’m only sighing
As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don’t hate nothing at all
Except hatred
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It’s easy to see without looking too far
That not much is really sacred
While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked
An’ though the rules of the road have been lodged
It’s only people’s games that you got to dodge
And it’s alright, Ma, I can make it
Advertising signs they con
You into thinking you’re the one
That can do what’s never been done
That can win what’s never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you
You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you
A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
To satisfy, insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to
Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to
For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Cultivate their flowers to be
Nothing more than something they invest in
While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society’s pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he’s in
But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it’s alright, Ma, if I can’t please him
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn’t talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony
While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer’s pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death’s honesty
Won’t fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Graveyards, false gods, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough, what else can you show me?
And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They’d probably put my head in a guillotine
But it’s alright, Ma, it’s life, and life only"

Now they're laughing secretly
It's funny to everyone but me

Good riddance to a bad affair
But how can I do what my head tells me to
When my heart tells me how much I care

You’re gonna have a nightmare
And never wake up

And your head’s gonna be in a knot
But the pills are gonna cost more

For five cents a quart
You’re gonna look in your moneybags
And find you’re one cent short

You’re gonna yell and scream
“Don’t anybody care?”
You’re gonna hear out a voice say
“Shoulda listened when you heard the word down there”

I can't help it
If you might think I am odd

When there is no more
You cut to the core
Quicker than anyone I knew
When I'm all alone
In the great unknown
I'll remember you

I'll remember you
At the end of the trail
I had so much left to do
I had so little time to fail
There's some people that
You don't forget
Even though you've only seen 'em one time or two
When the roses fade
And I'm in the shade
I'll remember you

Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?
Didn't I, didn't I try to care?
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
With the rain blowing in your hair?
I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piney wood
It was you who came right through
It was you who understood
Though I'd never say
That I done it the way
That you'd have liked me to
In the end
My dear sweet friend
I'll remember you"

You know she don't come

And then she ?? bread, but I
You know, she’s sucking out the breath of me

I’m Not There,I'm Not There (Ft. The Band),Bob Dylan,"It's alright
And then she's all too tight
In my neighbourhood
She cries both day and night
I know it because it was there
It's a milestone
But she down on her luck
And she daily so lonely
But to make hard to buck
I remain
I believe where she's stoppin'
If she wants time to care
I believe that she'd look upon
Deciding to care
And I go by the Lord in a way
She's on my way
But I don't belong there
No I don't belong to her
I don't belong to anybody
She's my prize-forsaken angel
But she don't hear me cry
She's a lone-hearted mystic
And she dain't carry on
When I'm there she's alright
But when she's not when I'm gone
Heaven knows that the answers
She's don't call no one
She's the way, assailin' beautiful
She's mine for the one
And I lost her heavy tension
By temptations does it runs
But she don't holler me
But I'm not there, I'm gone
Now I've cried tonight
Like I cried the night before
And I'm least on the high string
But I dream about the door
It's a long, she's forsaken
By her fate, ways to tell
It don't hang by formation
She's smiled, said thee well
Now went out treat the layway
I was born to love her
But she knows that the kingdom weighs
So high above her
And I run but I race
But it's not too fast to slim
But I don't perceive her
I'm not there, I'm gone
Well it's all about dead years'n
And I cried for her veil
I don't need anybody now
Beside me to tell
And it's all affirmation
I perceive but it's not
She's an old-hearted beauty
But she don't like the spot
And she come
Yes she's gone like the rainbow
The shining yesterday
But now she's warm beside me and
I'd like to hear to stay
She's a unforsaken beauty
And don't trust anyone
And I wish I was beside her
But I'm not there, I'm gone
Well it's a too-hard to stakin'
And I don't far believe
It's all bad for abusing
An' she's hard, too hard to leave
It's unknown, it's a crime
The way she mauls me around
But she told, phoned to hate me
But it's doomed to make a clown
Yes, I believe that it's rightful
Oh I believe it in my mind
I been told like I said when I before
Carry on the grind
And she's all good to tole her
Like I said, carry on
I wish I was there to help her
But I'm not there, I'm gone"

I’m a Fool to Want You,I'm a Fool to Want You,Bob Dylan,"I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too
I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss, not mine alone
To share a kiss that the devil has known
Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come a time when I would need you
And once again these words I'll have to say
I'm a fool to want you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong, I can't get along without you
Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come a time when I would need you

I've made up my mind to give myself to you
If I had the wings of a snow white dove
I'd preach the gospel, the gospel of love
A love so real, a love so true
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
Take me out traveling, you're a traveling man
Show me something I don't understand
I'm not what I was, things aren't what they were
I'll go far away from home with her
I traveled a long road of despair
I met no other traveler there
Lot of people gone, lot of people I knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
Well, my heart's like a river, a river that sings
Just takes me a while to realize things
I've seen the sunrise, I've seen the dawn
I'll lay down beside you when everyone's gone
I've traveled from the mountains to the sea
I hope that the gods go easy with me
I knew you'd say yes, I'm saying it too

Jack-A-Roe,Jack-A-Roe,Bob Dylan,"Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell

She had sweethearts a-plenty and men of high degree
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be
Oh, her true love e'er to be
""Oh daughter, oh daughter, your body I will confine
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind
Oh, would ever suit your mind
""This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine
Oh, would have this heart of mine
Now Jackie's gone sailing with trouble on his mind
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away
""Before you step onboard, sir, your name I'd like to know.""
She smiled all in her countenance, said, ""They call me Jack-A-Roe
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe.""
""Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannonball
""I know my waist is slender and my fingers they are small
But they would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall.""
The war soon being over, they hunted all around
Among the dead and dying her darling love she found
Oh, her darling love she found
She picked him up all in her arms and carries him to town
And sent for her physician to quickly heal his wounds
Oh, to quickly heal his wounds
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree
This couple they got married, so why not you and me
Oh, so why not you and me"

Oh I seen better days and I'm putting up with these
But there's too many people and they're all too hard to please
Cause I was born in the country, she thinks I'm easy to rule
Cause I was born in the country, she thinks I'm easy to rule
She tried to hitch me to her wagon, she wants to drive me like a mule
You know I bought the groceries and I paid the rent
You know I bought the groceries and I paid the rent
She tried to make me wash her clothes but I got good common sense
I said if you don't want me, why don't you tell me so?
I said if you don't want me, why don't you tell me so?
Cause it ain't like a man that ain't got nowhere to go
I believe I'm giving you sugar for sugar, let you get salt for salt
I believe I'm giving you sugar for sugar, let you get salt for salt
And if you can't get along with me, well it's your own fault
Now you want me to love you and you treat me mean
How do you want me to love you if you keep a-treating me mean?
You're my daily thought and my nightly dream
Sometimes I think that you too sweet to die
Sometimes I think that you too sweet to die
And another time I think you ought to be buried alive"
Jet Pilot,Jet Pilot,Bob Dylan,"Well, she's got Jet Pilot eyes from her hips on down
All the bombardiers are trying to force her out of town
She's five feet nine and she carries a monkey wrench
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch
She got all the downtown boys, all at her command
But you've got to watch her closely cause she ain't no woman
She's a man"
Jim Jones,Jim Jones,Bob Dylan,"Come and listen for a moment, lads
And hear me tell my tale
How across the sea from England
I was condemned to sail
Now the jury found me guilty
Then says the judge, says he
""Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you
Across the stormy sea
But take a tip before you ship
To join the iron gang
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay
Or else you'll surely hang
Or else you'll surely hang,"" says he
""And after that, Jim Jones
It's high above on the gallows tree
The crows will pick your bones.""

And our ship was high upon the sea
Then pirates came along
But the soldiers on our convict ship
Were full five hundred strong
For they opened fire and somehow drove
That pirate ship away
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship
Than gone to Botany Bay
With the storms ragin' round us
And the winds a-blowin' gale
I'd rather have drowned in misery
Than gone to New South Wales
Now it's day and night and the irons clang
And like poor galley slaves
We toil and toil, and when we die
Must fill dishonored graves
And it's by and by I'll slip my chains
Well, into the bush I'll go
And I'll join the bush rangers there
Jack Donohue and co
And some dark night, when everything
Is silent in the town
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all
I'll gun the flogger down
Oh, I'll give the law
A little shock
Remember what I say
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones
In chains to Botany Bay"
Joey,Joey,Bob Dylan,"Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
Always on the outside of whatever side there was
When they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered
“Just because”
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last
They called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast”
Some say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue

Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away?

There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof
The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim
“Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame”
But Joey stepped up, and he raised his hands, said, “We’re not those kind of men
It’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again”


The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith
They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with
“What time is it?” said the judge to Joey when they met
“Five to ten,” said Joey. The judge says, “That’s exactly what you get”
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike
His closest friends were black men because they seemed to understand
What it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand
When they let him out in ’71 he’d lost a little weight
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
To the boss he said, “I have returned and now I want what’s mine”


It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
“I’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one”
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe
Emptied out the register, said, “Tell them it was Crazy Joe”
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork
He pushed the table over to protect his family
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy


Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep
I heard his best friend Frankie say, “He is not dead, he’s just asleep”
Then I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born
And someday if God’s in heaven overlooking His preserve
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve"
John Brown,John Brown,Bob Dylan,"John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore
His mama sure was proud of him!
He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all
His mama’s face broke out all in a grin

“Oh son, you look so fine, I’m glad you’re a son of mine
You make me proud to know you hold a gun
Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get
And we’ll put them on the wall when you come home”

As that old train pulled out, John’s ma began to shout
Telling’ everyone in the neighborhood:
“That’s my son that’s about to go, he’s a soldier now, you know”
She made well sure her neighbors understood

She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
As she showed them to the people from next door
And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
And these things you called a good old-fashioned war
Oh! Good old-fashioned war!
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come
They ceased to come for about ten months or more
Then a letter finally came saying, “Go down and meet the train
Your son’s a-coming home from the war”

She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
But she could not see her soldier son in sight
But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last
When she did she could hardly believe her eyes

Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
And he wore a metal brace around his waist
He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know
While she couldn’t even recognize his face!
Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face

“Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done
How is it you come to be this way?”
He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
And the mother had to turn her face away
“Don’t you remember, Ma, when I went off to war
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
I was on the battleground, you were home. Acting proud
You wasn’t there standing in my shoes”

“Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?
I’m a-tryin’ to kill somebody or die tryin’
But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
And I saw that his face looked just like mine”
Oh! Lord! Just like mine!

“And I couldn’t help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink
That I was just a puppet in a play
And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke
And a cannon ball blew my eyes away”

As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock
At seeing’ the metal brace that helped him stand
But as he turned to go, he called his mother close
And he dropped his medals down into her hand"
John Wesley Harding,John Wesley Harding,Bob Dylan,"John Wesley Harding
Was a friend to the poor
He traveled a'with a gun in ev'ry hand
All along this countryside
He opened a'many a door
But he was never known
To hurt an honest man

’Twas down in Chaynee County
A time they talk about
With his lady by his side
He took a stand
And soon the situation there
Was all but straightened out
For he was always known
To lend a helping hand

All across the telegraph
His name it did resound
But no charge held against him
Could they prove
And there was no man around
Who could track or chain him down
He was never known
To make a foolish move"
Johnny Todd,Johnny Todd,Bob Dylan,"Johnny Todd he took a notion
For to cross the ocean wide
And he left his love behind him
Walkin' down by the Liverpool tide
For a week she wept full sorrows
Tore her hair and wrung her hands
Till she met another sailor
Walkin' down by the Liverpool sands
Why fair maid are you a-weeping
For your Johnny gone to sea?
If you wed with me tomorrow
I'll be by you constantly
I will buy you clothes and blankets
I'll buy you a wedding ring
You shall have a gilded cradle
For to rock you baby in
Johnny Todd came home from sailin'
Sailin' on that ocean wide
And he found his fair and false one
Was another sailor's bride
Now, all you men who go a-sailing
For to fight the foreign foe
Never leave, never leave love like Johnny
Marry her before you go"
Jokerman,Jokerman,Bob Dylan,"Standing on the waters casting your bread
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
Distant ships sailing into the mist
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
Freedom just around the corner for you
But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame
Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery grey
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat
Take the motherless children off the street
And place them at the feet of a harlot
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman"
Jolene,Jolene,Bob Dylan,"Well you're coming down High Street, walking in the sun
You make the dead man rise, and holler she's the one

Baby, I am the king and you're the queen

Well it's a long old highway, don't ever end
I've got a Saturday night special, I'm back again
I'll sleep by your door, lay my life on the line
You probably don't know, but I'm going to make you mine
Jolene, Jolene
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen

I keep my hands in my pocket, I'm moving along
People think they know, but they're all wrong
You're something nice, I'm going to grab my dice
I can't say I haven't paid the price
Jolene, Jolene
Baby I am the king and you're the queen

Well I found out the hard way, I've had my fill
You can't find somebody with his back to a hill
Those big brown eyes, they set off a spark
When you hold me in your arms things don't look so dark

Baby I am the king and you're the queen"

She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman

She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman

And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what’s worse
Is this pain in here
I can’t stay in here
Ain’t it clear that—
I just can’t fit
Yes, I believe it’s time for us to quit
When we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don’t let on that you knew me when

And negativity don't pull you through

And they really make a mess outta you

Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her ""Thanks a lot""

I don't have the strength
To get up and take another shot

She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon
Up on Housing Project Hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must pick one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're lookin' to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man, they expect the same

Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the Sergeant-at-Arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up Angel
Who just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left lookin' just like a ghost

I started out on Burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to bluff

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can’t shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is coming down
I feel I’m knockin' on heaven’s door

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh"
Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie,Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie,Bob Dylan,"I have a poem here. It's not a poem, it's... This is the first concert I played alone in New York, really. An a fellow in Brooklyn State Hospital, his name is Woody Guthrie. But Woody is more than a folk singer. He's really something else more than a folk singer and there's this book coming out that's dedicated to him. And they asked me to write something about Woody, like what does Woody mean to you in 25 words. And I couldn't do it, I wrote out 5 pages and I have it here. I have it here by accident actually. But I'd like to say this out loud. So this is my feelings towards Woody Guthrie. Cannot really be told in how many records of his I buy, it's a lot more than that actually. So if you can roll along with this thing here this is called ""Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie""

When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb
When yer laggin' behind an' losing yer pace
In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race
No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up
If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup
If the wind's got you sideways with one hand holdin' on
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone
And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it
And the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it
And yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long
And you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away
And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'
And yer rope is a-slidin' cause yer hands are a-drippin'
And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys
And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'
And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'
And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'
And yer whole world's a-slamming  and banging
And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm
And to yourself you sometimes say
""I never knew it was gonna be this way
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born""
And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet
And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air
And the whole world's a-watching with a window peek stare
And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying
And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're frying
And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet
And you need it badly but it lays on the street
And yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat
And you think yer ears might a been hurt
Or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt
And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush
When you were faked out an' fooled while facing a four flush
And all the time you were holdin' three queens
And it's making you mad, it's makin' you mean
Like in the middle of Life magazine
Bouncin' around a pinball machine
And there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying
That somebody someplace oughta be hearin'
But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed
And no matter how you try you just can't say it
And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it
And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head
And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead
And the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth
And his jaws start closing with you underneath
And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign
And you say to yourself just what am I doing
On this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'
On this curve I'm hanging
On this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking
In this air I'm inhaling
Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard
Why am I walking, where am I running
What am I saying, what am I knowing
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in the song I'm singin'
In the tune I'm humming, in the words I'm writin'
In the words that I'm thinking
In this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'
Who am I helping, what am I breaking
What am I giving, what am I taking
But you try with your whole soul best
Never to think these thoughts and never to let
Them kind of thoughts gain ground
Or make yer heart pound
But then again you know when they're around
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
'Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping
And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping
And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'
And you can't remember for the best of yer thinking
If that was you in the dream that was screaming
And you know that it's something special you're needin'
And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'
And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding
And you need something special
Yeah, you need something special all right
You need a fast flying train on a tornado track
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back
You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever
That knows yer troubles a hundred times over
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race
That won't laugh at yer looks
Your voice or your face
And by any number of bets in the book
Will be rolling long after the bubblegum craze
You need something to open up a new door
To show you something you seen before
But overlooked a hundred times or more
You need something to open your eyes
You need something to make it known
That it's you and no one else that owns
That spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting
That the world ain't got you beat
That it ain't got you licked
It can't get you crazy no matter how many
Times you might get kicked
You need something special all right
You need something special to give you hope
But hope's just a word
That maybe you said or maybe you heard
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve
But that's what you need man, and you need it bad
And yer trouble is you know it too good
'Cause you look an' you start getting the chills

'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill
And it ain't on Macy's window sill
And it ain't on no rich kid's road map
And it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ
And it ain't on that dimlit stage
With that half-wit comedian on it
Ranting and raving and taking yer money
And you think it's funny
No you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club
And sure as hell you're bound to tell
That no matter how hard you rub
You just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub
No, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you
And it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you
And it ain't in no cardboard-box house
Or down any movie star's blouse
And you can't find it on the golf course
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus
And it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes
And it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons
And it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices
That come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'
Sayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry
When you can't even sense if they got any insides
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows
No you'll not now or no other day
Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache
And inside it the people made of molasses
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies
Who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack
And before you can count from one to ten
Do it all over again but this time behind yer back
My friend
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl
And play games with each other in their sand-box world
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
That run around gallant
And make all rules for the ones that got talent
And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And think they're foolin' you
The ones who jump on the wagon
Just for a while cause they know it's in style
To get their kicks, get out of it quick
And make all kinds of money and chicks
And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat
Sayin', ""Christ do I gotta be like that
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel
Good God Almighty
THAT STUFF AIN'T REAL""
No but that ain't yer game, it ain't yer race
You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face
You gotta look some other place
And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'
Where do you look for this oil well gushin'
Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there
And out there somewhere
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways
You can touch and twist
And turn two kinds of doorknobs
You can either go to the church of your choice
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital
You'll find God in the church of your choice
You'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital

And though it's only my opinion
I may be right or wrong
You'll find them both
In the Grand Canyon
At sundown"
Lay Down Your Weary Tune,Lay Down Your Weary Tune,Bob Dylan,"Lay down your weary tune, lay down
Lay down the song you strum
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
No voice can hope to hum

Struck by the sounds before the sun
I knew the night had gone
The morning breeze like a bugle blew
Against the drums of dawn


The ocean wild like an organ played
The seaweed's wove its strands
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed
Against the rocks and sands


I stood unwound beneath the skies
And clouds unbound by laws
The crying rain like a trumpet sang
And asked for no applause

The last of leaves fell from the trees
And clung to a new love's breast
The branches bare like a banjo played
To the winds that listened best
I gazed down in the river's mirror
And watched its winding strum
The water smooth ran like a hymn
And like a harp did hum"
Lay Lady Lay,Lay Lady Lay,Bob Dylan,"Lay, lady, lay

Lenny Bruce,Lenny Bruce,Bob Dylan,"Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on
Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon
He was an outlaw, that’s for sure
More of an outlaw than you ever were
Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit’s livin’ on and on

Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn’t work out
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin’ about
Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies’ heads
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds
He’s on some other shore, he didn’t wanna live anymore

Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn’t commit any crime
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time
I rode with him in a taxi once
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months
Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone

They said that he was sick ’cause he didn’t play by the rules
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had"
Leopard-Skin Pill Box Hat,Leopard-Skin Pill Box Hat,Bob Dylan,"Well, I see you got your
Brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
Yes, I see you got your
Brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
Well, you must tell me, baby
How your head feels under something like that
Under your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat

Well, you look so pretty in it
Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Yes, I just want to see
If it’s really the expensive kind
You know it balances on your head
Just like a mattress balances
On a bottle of wine
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat

Well, if you want to see the sun rise
Honey, I know where
We'll go out and see it sometime
We’ll both just sit there and stare
Me with my belt wrapped around my head
And you just sittin' there
In your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat

Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you
""It’s bad for your health,"" he said
Yes, I disobeyed his orders
I came to see you
But I found him there instead
You know, I don’t mind you cheatin' on me
But I sure wish he’d take that off his head
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat

Well, I see you got a new boyfriend
You know, I never seen him before
Well, I saw you making love with him
You forgot to close the garage door
You might think he loves you for your money
But I know what he really loves you for
It’s your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat"
Let It Be Me,Let It Be Me,Bob Dylan,"I bless the day I found you
I want my arms around you
And so I beg you: Let it be me

Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me

Each time we meet, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love, what would life be ?

So never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always let it be me"
Let Me Die in My Footsteps,Let Me Die in My Footsteps,Bob Dylan,"I will not go down under the ground
’Cause somebody tells me that death’s coming around
An’ I will not carry myself down to die
When I go to my grave my head will be high
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground
There’s been rumors of war and wars that have been
The meaning of life has been lost in the wind
And some people thinking that the end is close by
’Stead of learning to live they are learning to die
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground
I don’t know if I’m smart but I think I can see
When someone is pulling the wool over me
And if this war comes and death’s all around
Let me die on this land ’fore I die underground
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground
There’s always been people that have to cause fear
They’ve been talking of the war now for many long years
I have read all their statements and I’ve not said a word
But now Lawd God, let my poor voice be heard
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leaves
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground
Go out in your country where the land meets the sun
See the craters and the canyons where the waterfalls run
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho
Let every state in this union seep down deep in your souls
And you’ll die in your footsteps
Before you go down under the ground"
Let’s Keep It Between Us,Let's Keep It Between Us,Bob Dylan,"Let's keep it between us
These people meddlin' in our affairs, they're not our friends
Let's keep it between us
Before doors close and our togetherness comes to an end
They'll turn you against me and me against you 'til we don't know who to trust
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
Let's keep it between us
We've been through too much tough times that they never shared
They've had nothing to say to us before
Now all of a sudden it's as if they've always cared
All we need is honesty, a little humility and trust
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
I know we're not perfect
Then again, neither are they
They act like we got to live for them as if there just ain't no other way
And it's makin' me kind of tired
Can we just lay back for a moment
Before we wake up and find ourselves in a daze that's got us out of our minds?
There must be something we're overlooking here
We better drop down now and get back behind the lines
There's some things not fit for human ears, some things don't need to be discussed
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
They'll tell you one thing and me another
'Til we don't know who to trust
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
Let's keep it between us
Before it all snaps and goes too far
If we can't deal with this by ourselves
Tell me we ain't worse off than they think we are
Backseat drivers don't know the feel of the wheel, but they sure know how to make a fuss
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
Can we keep it between us?"
Let’s Stick Together,Let's Stick Together,Bob Dylan,"Well, a young marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred
The man put us together, now, you wanna make it
Stick together
Come on, come on, stick together

You know, you made a vow, not to leave one another, never
Well, ya never miss you water till your well runs dry
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together
Come on, come on, stick together
We made a vow, not to leave one another, never

Well, ya never miss your water till your well runs dry
Come one, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together
Come on, come on, stick together
You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never

It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy
Let's stick together
Come on, come on, stick together
You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never"
License to Kill,License to Kill,Bob Dylan,"Man thinks because he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
And if things don’t change soon, he will
Oh, man has invented his doom
First step was touching the moon

Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And they set him on a path where he’s bound to get ill
Then they bury him with stars
Sell his body like they do used cars

Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sits there facing the hill
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

Now, he’s hell-bent for destruction, he’s afraid and confused
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill
All he believes are his eyes
And his eyes, they just tell him lies
But there’s a woman on my block
Sitting there in a cold chill
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

You may be a noisemaker, spirit maker
Heartbreaker, backbreaker
Leave no stone unturned
May be an actor in a plot
That might be all that you got
Till your error you clearly learn

Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And when he sees his reflection, he’s fulfilled
Oh, man is opposed to fair play
He wants it all and he wants it his way

Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who going to take away his license to kill?"
Life Is Hard,Life Is Hard,Bob Dylan,"The evening winds are still
I've lost the way and will
Can't tell you where they went
I just know what they meant
I'm always on my guard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

The friend you used to be
So near and dear to me
You slipped so far away
Where did we go a-stray
I pass the old schoolyard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

Ever since the day
The day you went away
I felt that emptiness so wide
I don't know what's wrong or right
I just know I need strength to fight
Strength to fight that world outside
Since we've been out of touch
I haven't felt that much
From day to barren day
My heart stays locked away
I walk the boulevard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

The sun is sinking low
I guess it's time to go
I feel a chilly breeze
In place of memories
My dreams are locked and barred
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me"

Like a Rolling Stone,Like a Rolling Stone,Bob Dylan,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?"
Lily of the West,Lily of the West,Bob Dylan,"When first I came to Louisville, some pleasure there to find
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips, like arrows pierced my breast
And the name she bore was Flora, the lily of the west

I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find
But she turned unto another man whose sore distressed my mind
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest
Then go, my lovely Flora, the lily of the west

Away down in yonder shady grove, a man of high degree
Conversing with my Flora there, it seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him it sore did me oppress
I was betrayed by Flora, the lily of the west

I stepped up my rival, dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar, and body made him stand
Seeing mad by desperation I pierced him to the breast
All this for lovely Flora, the lily of the west

I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the west"
"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts","Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts",Bob Dylan,"The festival was over, and the boys were all planning for a fall
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down
Anyone with any sense had already left town
He was standing in the doorway looking like the Jack of Hearts

He moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads
Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin
“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts

Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide
A gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts

Big Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine
He made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town
She slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear
“Sorry, darling, that I’m late,” but he didn't seem to hear
He was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts

“I know I’ve seen that face somewhere,” Big Jim was thinking to himself
“Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him
Staring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts

Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere
But she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts

The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined
The drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind
It was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king
No, nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim’s wife
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died
She was gazing to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts

Lily took her dress off, buried it away
“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must
Have known it would someday
Be careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint
I’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re looking like a saint”
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts

The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair
“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge was drunk
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk
There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts

No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
And Big Jim was standing there, ya couldn't say surprised
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes
She was with Big Jim but she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
And cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
For one more member who had business back in town
But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts

The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink
The hanging judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink
The only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts

The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair”
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair
She was thinking ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw
Thinking ’bout Rosemary and thinking about the law
But most of all she was thinking ’bout the Jack of Hearts"

Little Maggie,Little Maggie,Bob Dylan,"Oh, where is little Maggie
Over yonder she stands
Rifle on her shoulder
Six-shooter in her hand

How can I ever stand it
Just to see them two blue eyes
Shining like some diamonds
Like some diamonds in the sky

Rather be in some lonely hollow
Where the sun don't ever shine
Than to see you be another man's darling
And to know that you'll never be mine

Well, it's march me away to the station
With my suitcase in my hand
Yes, march me away to the station
I'm off to some far-distant land

Sometimes I have a nickel
And sometimes I have a dime
Sometimes I have ten dollars
Just to pay for little Maggie's wine
Pretty flowers are made for blooming
Pretty stars are made to shine
Pretty girls are made for boy's love
Little Maggie was made for mine

Well, yonder stands little Maggie
With a dram glass in her hand
She's a drinking down her troubles
Over courting some other man"
Little Sadie,Little Sadie,Bob Dylan,"Went out last night to take a little round
I met my Little Sadie and I brought her down
I ran right home and I went to bed
With a forty-four smokeless under my head

I began to think what a deed I'd done
I grabbed my hat and I began to run
I made a good run but I ran too slow
They overtook me down in Jericho

Standing on a corner a ringing' my bell
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville
He said ""Young man is your name Brown
Remember you blowed Sadie down?""

""Oh yes sir, my name is Lee
I murdered Little Sadie in the first degree
First degree and second degree
If you've got any papers will you serve them to me?""

Well they took me down town and they dressed me in black
They put me on a train and they sent me back
I had no one to go my bail
They crammed me back into the county jail
Oh, yes they did
The judge and the jury they took their stand
The judge had the papers in his right hand
Forty-one days, forty-one nights
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes
Oh, no!

Went out last night to take a little round
I met Little Sadie and I blowed her down
I ran right home and I went to bed
A forty-four smokeless under my head"

Lone Pilgrim,Lone Pilgrim,Bob Dylan,"I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
And pensively stood by his tomb
When in a low whisper I heard something say:
How sweetly I sleep here alone
The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
And gathering storms may arise
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul
The tears are all wiped from my eyes
The cause of my master compelled me from home
No kindred or relative nigh
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb
My soul flew to mansions on high
Go tell my companion and children most dear
To weep not for me now I'm gone
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Has kindly assisted me home"
Lonesome Day Blues,Lonesome Day Blues,Bob Dylan,"Well, today has been a sad ol’ lonesome day

With my mind a million miles away

Well, they’re doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor
They’re doing the double shuffle, they’re throwing sand on the floor
When I left my long-time darling
She was standing in the door

Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war

Yeah the road’s washed out—weather not fit for man or beast
Funny, how the things you have the hardest time parting with
Are the things you need the least

I’m forty miles from the mill—I’m dropping it into overdrive
Setting my dial on the radio
I wish my mother was still alive

I see your lover-man coming—coming across the barren field

He’s not a gentleman at all—he’s rotten to the core
He’s a coward and he steals

Well my captain he’s decorated—he’s well schooled and he’s skilled
My captain, he’s decorated—he’s well schooled and he’s skilled
He’s not sentimental—don’t bother him at all
How many of his pals have been killed

I tell myself something’s coming
But it never does

I’m gonna spare the defeated—I’m gonna speak to the crowd
I’m gonna spare the defeated, boys, I’m going to speak to the crowd
I am going to teach peace to the conquered
I’m gonna tame the proud

Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carrol,Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carrol,Bob Dylan,"William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for
Your tears
William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was
Snarling
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for
Your tears
Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn't even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger
But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for
Your tears
In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the
Level
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and
Persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
Oh, but you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all
Fears
Bury the rag deep in your face, for now's the time for your
Tears"
Lonesome River Edge,Lonesome River Edge,Bob Dylan,"I held her hand on a cobblestone corner

I said goodbye... night train rolling
On a lonesome day, by the lonesome river edge
But that's not the one I was thinking of.."
Lonesome Whistle Blues,Lonesome Whistle Blues,Bob Dylan,"I was riding number 9
Heading south from Carolina
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow
Got in trouble, had to roam
Left my girl, left my home
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow
Just a kid, acting smart
I went and broke my baby's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off that Georgia Main
And locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow
All I do is sit and cry
As the evening train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
And my head turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that girl of mine
'cos I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
And my head turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that girl of mine
'cos I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow"
"Long Ago, Far Away","Long Ago, Far Away",Bob Dylan,"To preach of peace and brotherhood
Oh, what might be the cost!
A man he did it long ago
And they hung him on a cross
Long ago, far away
Those things don’t happen nowadays

The chains of slaves they dragged the ground
With heads and hearts hung low
But it was during Lincoln’s time
And it was long ago
Long ago, far away
Those things like that don’t happen
No more, nowadays, do they

The war guns they bombed and blazed
The whole world bled its blood
Men’s bodies rotted on the ground
As their graves were made in mud
Long ago, far away
Those kind of things don’t happen
No more, nowadays
One man had much money
One man had not enough to eat
One man he lived just like a king
The other man begged on the street
Long ago, far away
Things like that don’t happen
No more, nowadays

One man died of a knife so sharp
One man died from the bullet of a gun
One man died of a broken heart
To see the lynching’ of his son
Long ago, far away
Things like that don’t happen
No more, nowadays

Gladiators killed themselves
It was during the Roman times
People cheered with bloodshot grins
As eyes and minds went blind
Long ago, far away
Things like that don't happen
No more, nowadays
And the talk of peace and brotherhood
Oh, what might be the cost
Man he did it long ago, and hung him on a cross
Long ago, far away
Things like that don't happen
No more, nowadays, do they"
Long Time Gone,Long Time Gone,Bob Dylan,"My parents raised me tenderly
I was their only son
My mind got mixed with rambling
When I was all so young
And I left my home the first time
When I was twelve and one
I’m a long time a-comin’, Maw
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

On the western side of Texas
On the Texas plains
I tried to find a job o’ work
But they said l’s young of age
My eyes they burned when I heard
“Go home where you belong!”
I’m a long time a-comin’
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

I remember when I’s rambling
Around with the carnival trains
Different towns, different people
Somehow they’re all the same
I remember children’s faces best
I remember traveling on
I’m a long time a-comin’
I’ll be a long time gone
I once loved a fair young maid
An’ I ain’t too big to tell
If she broke my heart a single time
She broke it ten or twelve
I walked and talked all by myself
I did not tell no one
I’m a long time a-comin’, babe
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

Many times by the highwayside
I tried to flag a ride
With bloodshot eyes and gritting teeth
I’d watch the cars roll by
The empty air hung in my head
I’s thinkin’ all day long
I’m a long time a-comin’
I’ll be a long time gone

You might see me on your crossroads
When I’m a-passin’ through
Remember me how you wished to
As I’m a-Driftin’ from your view
I ain’t got the time to think about it
I got too much to get done
Well, I’m a long time coming
An’ I’ll be a long time gone
If I can’t help somebody
With a word or song
If I can’t show somebody
They are traveling’ wrong
But I know I ain’t no prophet
An’ I ain’t no prophet’s son
I’m just a long time a-comin’
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

So you can have your beauty
It’s skin deep and it only lies
And you can have your youth
It’ll rot before your eyes
Just give to me my gravestone
With it clearly carved upon:
“I’s a long time a-comin’
An’ I’ll be a long time gone”"
Long and Wasted Years,Long and Wasted Years,Bob Dylan,"It's been such a long long time
Since we loved each other when our hearts were true
One time, for one brief day, I was the man for you
Last night I heard you talking in your sleep
Saying things you shouldn't say, oh baby
You just may have to go to jail someday

Is there a place we can go?
Is there anybody we can see?
Maybe it's the same for you as it is for me
I ain't seen my family in twenty years
That ain't easy to understand, they may be dead by now
I lost track of em after they lost their land

Shake it up baby, twist and shout
You know what it's all about
What are you doing out there in the sun anyway?
Don't you know, the sun can burn your brains right out

My enemy crashed into the dust
Stopped dead in his tracks and he lost his lust
He was run down hard and he broke apart
He died in shame, he had an iron heart
I wear dark glasses to cover my eyes
There are secrets in em that I can't disguise
Come back baby
If I hurt your feelings, I apologize

Two trains running side by side, forty miles wide
Down the eastern line
You don't have to go
I just came to you because you're a friend of mine

I think that when my back was turned
The whole world behind me burned
It's been a while
Since we walked down that long, long aisle

We cried on a cold and frosty morn
We cried because our souls were torn
So much for tears
So much for these long and wasted years"
Lord Protect My Child,Lord Protect My Child,Bob Dylan,"For his age, he’s wise
He’s got his mother’s eyes
There’s gladness in his heart
He’s young and he’s wild
My only prayer is, if I can’t be there
Lord, protect my child

As his youth now unfolds
He is centuries old
Just to see him at play makes me smile
No matter what happens to me
No matter what my destiny
Lord, protect my child

The whole world is asleep
You can look at it and weep
Few things you find are worthwhile
And though I don’t ask for much
No material things to touch
Lord, protect my child

He’s young and on fire
Full of hope and desire
In a world that’s been raped and defiled
If I fall along the way
And can’t see another day
Lord, protect my child
There’ll be a time I hear tell
When all will be well
When God and man will be reconciled
But until men lose their chains
And righteousness reigns
Lord, protect my child"
Lost Highway,Lost Highway,Bob Dylan,"I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
When I pass by, all the people say
""Just another guy on the lost highway.""
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies make a life like mine
Oh, the day we met, I went astray
I started rollin' down that lost highway
I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
When I pass by, all the people say
""Just another guy on the lost highway.""
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies make a life like mine
Oh, the day we met, I went astray
I started rollin' down that lost highway
I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord, I've paid the cost on the lost highway
Now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord, I've paid the cost on the lost highway
Now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway"

It runs both cold and deep

Some pretty little girl in Cornersville
Will mourn for your return.""

Would kill a little birdlike me."""
Love Minus Zero/No Limit,Love Minus Zero/No Limit,Bob Dylan,"My love she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
Yet she's true, like ice, like fire
People carry roses
And make promises by the hours
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can't buy her
In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall
Some speak of the future
My love she speaks softly
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all
The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even a pawn must hold a grudge
Statues made of match sticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks, she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge
The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers' nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
The wind howls like a hammer
The night blows rainy
My love she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing"
Love Sick,Love Sick,Bob Dylan,"I’m walking through streets that are dead
Walking, walking with you in my head
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired
And the clouds are weeping

Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Did I hear someone’s distant cry?
I spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile
While I was sleeping

I’m sick of love but I’m in the thick of it
This kind of love I’m so sick of it

I see, I see lovers in the meadow
I see, I see silhouettes in the window
I watch them ’till they’re gone and they leave me hanging on
To a shadow

I’m sick of love; I hear the clock tick
This kind of love; I’m lovesick
Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
Sometimes I want to take to the road and plunder
Could you ever be true? I think of you
And I wonder

I’m sick of love; I wish I’d never met you
I’m sick of love; I’m trying to forget you

Just don’t know what to do
I’d give anything to be with you"
Lunatic Princess,Lunatic Princess,Bob Dylan,"Why should you have to be so frantic

Maggie’s Farm,Maggie's Farm,Bob Dylan,"I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

Fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin' me insane

It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel
He hands you a dime
He asks you with a grin
If you're having a good time

Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks
The National Guard stands around his door
Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
Everybody says
She's the brains behind Pa

She's 68, but she says she's 54
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them

They say ""Sing while you slave"" and I just get bored
Ah, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more"
Make You Feel My Love,Make You Feel My Love,Bob Dylan,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven’t made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I’ve known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I’d go hungry, I’d go black and blue
I’d go crawling down the avenue
There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn’t do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love"
Making a Liar Out of Me,Making a Liar Out of Me,Bob Dylan,"I tell people you're just goin' through changes
And that you're acquanted both with night and day
That your money's good and you're just being courageous
On them burnin' bridges knowin' your feet are made of clay
Well I say you won't be destroyed by your inventions
That you brought it all under captivity
And that you really do have all the best intentions
But you're makin' a liar out of me

Well I say that you're just young and self-tormented
But that deep down you understand
The hopes and fears and dreams of the discontented
Who threaten now to overtake your promised land
Well I say you'd not sow discord among brothers
Nor drain a man of his integrity
But you'll remember the cries of orphans and their mothers
But you're makin' a liar out of me
But you're makin' a liar out of me

Well I say that, that ain't flesh and blood you're drinkin'
In the wounded empire of your fool's paradise
With a light above your head forever blinkin'
Turnin' virgins into merchandise
That you must have been beautiful when you were livin'
You remind me of some old-time used-to-be
I say you can be trusted with the power you been given
But you're makin' a liar out of me
So many things so hard to say as you stumble
To take refuge in your offices of shame
As the earth beneath my feet begins to rumble
And your young men die for nothin' not even fame
I say that someday you'll begin to trust us
And that your conscience not been slain by conformity
That you'll stand up unafraid to believe in justice
But you're makin' a liar out of me
You're makin' a liar out of me

Well I can hear the sound of distant thunder
From an open window at the end of every hall
Now that you're gone I got to wonder
If you ever were here at all
I say you never sacrificed my children
To some false god of infidelity
And that it's not the Tower of Babel that you're buildin'
But you're makin' a liar out of me
You're makin' a liar out of me
Now you're makin' a liar out of me"
"Mama, You Been on My Mind","Mama, You Been on My Mind",Bob Dylan,"Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
But mama you been on my mind

I don't mean trouble please don't put me down or get upset
I am not pleading, or saying I can't forget you
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet
Mama you been on my mind

Even though my eyes are hazy
And my thoughts they might be narrow
Where you been don't bother me
Or bring me down with sorrow
I don't even mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow
Mama you're just on my mind

I'm not asking you to say words like yes or no
Please, understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go
I'm just whispering to myself so I can't pretend that I don't know
Mama you are on my mind
When you wake up in the morning, baby look inside your mirror
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind"
Man Gave Names to All the Animals,Man Gave Names to All the Animals,Bob Dylan,"Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

He saw an animal that liked to growl
Big furry paws and he liked to howl
Great big furry back and furry hair
“Ah, think I’ll call it a bear”

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

He saw an animal up on a hill
Chewing up so much grass until she was filled
He saw milk coming out but he didn’t know how
“Ah, think I’ll call it a cow”

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago
He saw an animal that liked to snort
Horns on his head and they weren’t too short
It looked like there wasn’t nothing that he couldn’t pull
“Ah, think I’ll call it a bull”

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail
Real dirty face and a curly tail
He wasn’t too small and he wasn’t too big
“Ah, think I’ll call it a pig”

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

Next animal that he did meet
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep
“Ah, think I’ll call it a sheep”
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

He saw an animal as smooth as glass
Slithering his way through the grass
Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake"
Man in the Long Black Coat,Man in the Long Black Coat,Bob Dylan,"Crickets are chirping, the water is high
There’s a soft cotton dress on the line hangin’ dry
Window wide open, African trees
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note
She gone with the man
In the long black coat

Somebody seen him hanging around
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask
Somebody said from the Bible he’d quote
There was dust on the man
In the long black coat

Preacher was a talkin’, there’s a sermon he gave
He said every man’s conscience is vile and depraved
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
When it’s you who must keep it satisfied
It ain’t easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat
She gave her heart to the man
In the long black coat
There are no mistakes in life some people say
It is true sometimes you can see it that way
But people don't live or die, people just float
She went with the man
In the long black coat

There’s smoke on the water, it’s been there since June
Tree trunks uprooted, 'neath the high crescent moon
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force
Somebody is out there beating a dead horse
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote
She gone with the man
In the long black coat"
Man of Constant Sorrow,Man of Constant Sorrow,Bob Dylan,"I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I'll say goodbye to Colorado
Where I was born and partly raised

Your mother says that I'm a stranger
A face you'll never see no more
But there's one promise darling
I'll see you on God's golden shore

Through this open world I'm a-bound to ramble
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain
I'm a-bound to ride that morning railroad
Perhaps I'll die on that train

I'm a-going back to Colorado
The place that I've started from
If I'd know-ed how bad you'd treat me
Honey, I never would have come"
Man of Peace,Man of Peace,Bob Dylan,"Look out your window, baby, there’s a scene you’d like to catch
The band is playing “Dixie,” a man got his hand outstretched
Could be the Führer
Could be the local priest
You know sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

He got a sweet gift of gab, he got a harmonious tongue
He knows every song of love that ever has been sung
Good intentions can be evil
Both hands can be full of grease
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

Well, first he’s in the background, then he’s in the front
Both eyes are looking like they’re on a rabbit hunt
Nobody can see through him
No, not even the Chief of Police
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

Well, he catch you when you’re hoping for a glimpse of the sun
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton
He could be standing next to you
The person that you’d notice least
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull
I can smell something cooking
I can tell there’s going to be a feast
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

He’s a great humanitarian, he’s a great philanthropist
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed
He’ll put both his arms around you
You can feel the tender touch of the beast
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

Well, the howling wolf will howl tonight, the king snake will crawl
Trees that’ve stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall
Want to get married? Do it now
Tomorrow all activity will cease
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

Somewhere Mama’s weeping for her blue-eyed boy
She’s holding them little white shoes and that little broken toy
And he’s following a star
The same one them three men followed from the East
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace"
Man on the Street,Man on the Street,Bob Dylan,"Well I'll sing you a song, It ain't very long
About an old man, who never done wrong
How he died nobody can say
They found him dead in the street one day

Well, the crowd, they gathered one fine morn'
At the man whose clothes 'n' shoes were torn
There on the sidewalk he did lay
They stopped 'n' stared 'n' walked their way

Well, the p'liceman come and he looked around
""Get up, old man, or I'm a-takin' you down.""
He jabbed him once with his billy club
And the old man then rolled off the curb

Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said
""Call the wagon, this man is dead""
The wagon come, they loaded him in
I never saw the man again

Well, I've sung you my song, it ain't very long
About an old man who never done wrong
How he died no one can say
They found him dead in the street one day"
Marchin’ to the City,Marchin' to the City,Bob Dylan,"Well I'm sitting in church
In an old wooden chair
I knew nobody
Would look for me there
. . . Sorrow and pity
. . . Rule the earth and the skies
Looking for nothing
Anyone's eyes
Once I had pretty girls
Did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long
Snowflakes are falling
Around my head
Lord have mercy
It feel heavy like lead
. . . I been hit too hard
. . . Seen too much
Nothing can heal me now
But your touch
Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long
Loneliness
Got a mind of its own
The more people around
The more you feel alone
. . . I'm chained to the earth
. . . Like a silent slave
Trying to break free
Out of death's dark cave
Once I had a pretty girl
Done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long
Boys in the street
Beginning to play
Girls like birds
Flying away
. . . I'm carrying the roses
. . . That were given to me
And I'm thinking about paradise
Wondering what it might be
Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long
Go over to London
Maybe gay Paree
Follow the river
You get to the sea
. . . I was hoping we could drink from
. . . Life's clear streams
I was hoping we could dream
Life's pleasant dreams
Once I had a pretty girl
But she done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long
Well the weak get weaker
And the strong stay strong
The train keeps rolling
All night long
. . . She looked at me
. . . With an irresistible glance
With a smile
That could make all the planets dance
Once I had a pretty girl
She did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long
My house is on fire
Burning to the skies
I thought the rain clouds
But the clouds passed by
. . . When I'm gone
. . . You'll remember my name
I'm gonna win my way
To wealth and fame
Once I had a pretty girl
But she did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long
I don't know"
Mary Ann,Mary Ann,Bob Dylan,"Oh, fare thee well, my own true love, fare thee well but for a while
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann

Ten thousand miles away from home, ten thousand miles or more
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann

Oh, don't you see that crow fly high, she'll surely turn to white
If never I prove false to you
Let the day turn to night, my dear, Mary Ann

If I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
And a great big bowl for two to mix it in
I'd pour a drink for you my dear, Mary Ann
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you my dear, Mary Ann"
Mary and the Soldier,Mary and the Soldier,Bob Dylan,"Come all you lads of high renown
That would hear of a fair young maiden
And she roved out on a summer's day
For to view the soldiers paradin'
They marched so bold and they looked so gay
Their colors flyin' and the bands did play
And it caused young Mary for to say
""I'll wed you my gallant soldier.""
She viewed the soldiers on parade
And as they stood at their leisure
Mary to herself did say
""At last I've found my treasure.""
""But oh, how cruel my parents must be
Banishing my true love so far from me
Well I'll leave them all and I'll go with thee
My bold undaunted soldier.""
""Oh Mary dear, your parents' love
I pray don't be unruly
For when you're in a foreign land
Believe me you'll rue surely
Perhaps in battle I might fall
From a shot from an angry cannonball
And you so far from your daddy's hall
Be advised by a gallant soldier.""
""If I have fifty guineas in bright gold
Likewise a heart that's blunder
And I'd leave them all and I'll go with you
My bold undaunted soldier
So don't say no but let me go
And I will face the daring foe
We'll march together to and fro
I'll wed you my gallant soldier.""
And when he saw her loyalty
And Mary so true-hearted
He said, ""My darling, married we'll be
And nothin' but death will part us
And when we're in some foreign land
I'll guard you, darling, with my right hand
Hopes that God might stand a friend
To Mary and her gallant soldier."""
Masters Of War [Brandeis 1963],Masters Of War [Brandeis 1963],Bob Dylan,"Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You?that?build the big?bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that?hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks
You that never done nothin’
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it’s your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain
You fasten the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people’s blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud
You’ve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain’t worth the blood
That runs in your veins
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I’m young
You might say I’m unlearned
But there’s one thing I know
Though I’m younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul
And I hope that you die
And your death’ll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I’ll watch while you’re lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I’ll stand o’er your grave
’Til I’m sure that you’re dead"

Maybe Someday,Maybe Someday,Bob Dylan,"Maybe someday you’ll be satisfied
When you’ve lost everything you’ll have nothing left to hide
When you’re through running over things like you’re walking ’across the tracks
Maybe you’ll beg me to take you back
Maybe someday you’ll find out everybody’s somebody’s fool
Maybe then you’ll realize what it would have taken to keep me cool
Maybe someday when you’re by yourself alone
You’ll know the love that I had for you have been never my own

Maybe someday you’ll have nowhere to turn
You’ll look back and wonder ’bout the bridges you have burned
You’ll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
And you’ll see you look much better with me than you do with him
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down
Maybe someday, you will understand
That something for nothing is everybody’s plan

Maybe someday you’ll remember what you felt
When there was blood on the moon in the cotton belt
When both of us, baby, we're going through some sort of a test
Neither one of us could do what we do best
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough
Maybe someday, you’ll believe me when I say
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way
Maybe someday you’ll hear a voice from on high
Saying’, “For whose sake did you live, for whose sake did you die?”
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn’t do
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you
Always was a sucker for the right cross
Never wanted to go home ’till the last cent was lost
Maybe someday you will look back and see
That I made it so easy for you to follow me

Maybe someday there’ll be nothing to tell
I’m just as happy as you, baby, I just can’t say it so well
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike
There’s no excuse for you to say that we don’t think alike
You said you were going’ to Frisco, stay a couple of months
I always like San Francisco, I was there for a party once
Maybe someday you’ll see that it’s true
There was no greater love than what I had for you"
Maybe You’ll Be There,Maybe You’ll Be There,Bob Dylan,"Each time I see a crowd of people
Just like a fool I stop and stare
It's really not the proper thing to do
But maybe you'll be there
I go out walking after midnight
Along the lonely thoroughfare
It's not the time or place to look for you
But maybe you'll be there
You said your arms would always hold me
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this
Someday if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door
And maybe you'll be there"
Medicine Sunday,Medicine Sunday,Bob Dylan,"Well, that midnight train pulled on all down the track

By time the snow begins to thaw

They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
But you wouldn’t know it by me
Every day’s been darkness since you been gone

Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind
Well, I feel just like that rooster
Honey, ya treat me so unkind

Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
Well, you know I even outran the hound dogs

Look at the sun sinking like a ship
Ain’t that just like my heart, babe
When you kissed my lips?"
Melancholy Mood,Melancholy Mood,Bob Dylan,"Melancholy mood forever haunts me
Steals upon me in the night, forever taunts me
Oh, what a lonely soul am I, stranded high and dry
By a melancholy mood
Gone is every joy and inspiration
Tears are all I have to show, no consolation
All I can see is grief and gloom, till the crack of doom
Oh, melancholy mood
Deep in the night I search for a trace
Of a lingering kiss, a warm embrace
But love is a whimsy, as flimsy as lace
And my arms embrace an empty space
Melancholy mood, why must you blind me
Pity me and break the chains, the chains that bind me
Won't you release me, set me free, bring her back to me
Oh, melancholy mood"

Couldn't even eat my breakfast blues in my bread
Halla pleease, pleease don't do me wrong don't do me wrong
If you see my milkcow Lord Lord send her home
Well ma your calf is hungry I believe she needs a suck
But your milk is turning blue I believe she's out of luck
Halla pleease, pleease don't do me wrong don't do me wrong
If you see my milkcow Lord God send her home

Million Miles,Million Miles,Bob Dylan,"You took a part of me that I really miss
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
You told yourself a lie, that’s all right mama I told myself one too
I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

You took the silver, you took the gold
You left me standing out in the cold
People ask about you, I didn’t tell them everything I knew
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

I’m drifting in and out of dreamless sleep
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep
Did so many things I never did intend to do
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
I need every bit of it for the places that I go
Sometimes I wonder just what it’s all coming to
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

Well, I don’t dare close my eyes and I don’t dare wink
Maybe in the next life I’ll be able to hear myself think
Feel like talking to somebody but I just don’t know who
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you
The last thing you said before you hit the street
“Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet”
I said, “That’s all right mama you  you do what you gotta do”
Well, I’m trying to get closer. I’m still a million miles from you

Rock me, pretty baby; rock me ’till everything gets real
Rock me for a little while; rock me ’till there’s nothing left to feel
And I’ll rock you too
I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

Well, there’s voices in the night trying to be heard
I’m sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word
I know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two
Yes, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you"

There he still sits on top of the hill

Miss the Mississippi,Miss the Mississippi,Bob Dylan,"I'm growing tired of the big city nights
Tired of the glamour and tired of the sights
In all my dreams I am roaming once more
Back to my home on the old river shore
I am sad and weary far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you dear
Nights are dark and dreary everywhere I roam
Miss the Mississippi and you
Roaming the wide world over
Always along and blue, so blue
Nothing seems to cheer me under heaven's dome
Miss the Mississippi and you
Memories are bringing happy days of yore
Missing Mississippi and you
Mocking birds are singing around the cabin door
Missing Mississippi and you
Rolling the wide world over
Always alone and blue, so blue
Longing form my homeland, muddy water shore
Miss the Mississippi and you"
Mississippi,Mississippi,Bob Dylan,"Every step of the way we walk the line
Your days are numbered, so are mine
Time is piling’ up, we struggle and we scrape
We’re all boxed in, nowhere to escape

City’s just a jungle; more games to play
Trapped in the heart of it, trying' to get away
I was raised in the country, I been working’ in the town
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down

Got nothing' for you, I had nothing' before
Don’t even have anything for myself anymore
Sky full of fire, pain pouring’ down
Nothing you can sell me, I’ll see you around

All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well, the devil’s in the alley, mule’s in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
I was thinking’ 'bout the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleeping' in Rosie’s bed
Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees
So many things that we never will undo
I know you’re sorry, I’m sorry too

Some people will offer you their hand and some won’t
Last night I knew you, tonight I don’t
I need something strong to distract my mind
I’m gonna look at you ’til my eyes go blind

Well I got here following' the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well my ship’s been split to splinters and it’s sinking' fast
I’m drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it’s light and it’s free
I’ve got nothing but affection for all those who’ve sailed with me

Everybody moving if they ain’t already there
Everybody got to move somewhere
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow
Things should start to get interesting' right about now
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting’ to be kind
So give me your hand and say you’ll be mine

Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can’t come back all the way
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long"
Mixed-Up Confusion,Mixed-Up Confusion,Bob Dylan,"I got mixed up confusion
Man, it’s a-killing me

And they’re all too hard to please

Well, my hat’s in my hand
Babe, I’m walking down the line
An’ I’m looking for a woman
Whose head’s mixed up like mine

Well, my head’s full of questions
My temperature’s rising fast
Well, I’m looking for some answers
But I don’t know who to ask

But I’m walking and wondering
And my poor feet don’t ever stop
Seeing my reflection
I’m hung over, hung down, hung up!"
Moonlight,Moonlight,Bob Dylan,"The seasons they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
To hear again the songbird’s sweet melodious tone

The dusky light, the day is losing, Orchids, Poppies, Black-eyed Susan
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
The air is thick and heavy all along the levy
Where the geese into the countryside have flown
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Well, I’m preaching peace and harmony
The blessings of tranquility
Yet I know when the time is right to strike
I’ll take you cross the river dear
You’ve no need to linger here
I know the kinds of things you like
The clouds are turning crimson–the leaves fall from the limbs an’
The branches cast their shadows over stone
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerades of birds and bees
The petals, pink and white, the wind has blown
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
The trailing moss and mystic glow
Purple blossoms soft as snow
My tears keep flowing to the sea
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief
It takes a thief to catch a thief
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me
My pulse is running through my palm–the sharp hills are rising from
The yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?"
Moonshiner,Moonshiner,Bob Dylan,"I've been a moonshiner
For seventeen long years
I've spent all my money
On whiskey and beer
I go to some hollow
And sit at my still
And if whiskey dont kill me
Then I dont know what will

I go to some bar room
And drink with my friends
Where the women can't follow
And see what I spend
God bless them pretty women
I wish they was mine
Their breath is as sweet
The dew on the vine

Let me eat when I am hungry
Let me drink when I am dry
A dollar when I am hard up
Religion when I die
The whole world's a bottle
And life's but a dram
When the bottle gets empty
It sure ain't worth a damn"
Most Likely You Go Your Way,Most Likely You Go Your Way,Bob Dylan,"You say you love me
And you're thinkin' of me
But you know you could be wrong
You say you told me
That you wanna hold me
But you know you're not that strong
I just can't do what I done before
I just can't beg you any more
I'm gonna let you pass
And I'll go last
Then time will tell just who fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
You say you disturb me
And you don't deserve me
But you know sometimes you lie
You say you're shakin'
And you're always achin'
But you know how hard you try
Sometimes it gets so hard to care
It can't be this way ev'rywhere
And I'm gonna let you pass
Yes, and I'll go last
Then time will tell just who fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
The judge, he holds a grudge
He's gonna call on you
But he's badly built
And he walks on stilts
Watch out he don't fall on you
You say you're sorry
For tellin' stories
That you know I believe are true
You say ya got some
Other kinda lover
And yes, I believe you do
You say my kisses are not like his
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is
I'm just gonna let you pass
Yes, and I'll go last
Then time will tell who fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine"
Most of the Time,Most of the Time,Bob Dylan,"Most of the time
I’m clear focused all around
Most of the time
I can keep both feet on the ground
I can follow the path, I can read the signs
Stay right with it when the road unwinds
I can handle whatever I stumble upon
I don’t even notice she gone
Most of the time

Most of the time
It’s well understood
Most of the time
I wouldn’t change it if I could
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone
I can survive, I can endure
And I don’t even think about her
Most of the time

Most of the time
My head is on straight
Most of the time
I’m strong enough not to hate
I don’t build up illusion ’till it makes me sick
I ain’t afraid of confusion no matter how thick
I can smile in the face of mankind
Don’t even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time
Most of the time
She ain’t even in my mind
I wouldn’t know her if I saw her
She’s that far behind
Most of the time
I can’t even be sure
If she was ever with me
Or if I was ever with her

Most of the time
I’m halfway content
Most of the time
I know exactly where it all went
I don’t cheat on myself, I don’t run and hide
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside
I don’t compromise and I don’t pretend
I don’t even care if I ever see her again
Most of the time"
Mother of Muses,Mother of Muses,Bob Dylan,"Mother of Muses sing for me
Sing of the mountains and the deep dark sea
Sing of?the?lakes and the?nymphs of the forest
Sing your hearts?out, all your women of the chorus
Sing of honor and fate and glory be
Mother of Muses sing for me
Mother of Muses sing for my heart
Sing of a love too soon to depart
Sing of the heroes who stood alone
Whose names are engraved on tablets of stone
Who struggled with pain so the world could go free
Mother of Muses sing for me
Sing of Sherman, Montgomery, and Scott?
And of Zhukov, and Patton, and the battles they fought
Who cleared the path for Presley to sing
Who carved the path for Martin Luther King
Who did what they did and they went on their way
Man, I could tell their stories all day
I'm falling in love with Calliope
She don't belong to anyone, why not give her to me?
She's speaking to me, speaking with her eyes
I've grown so tired of chasing lies
Mother of Muses, wherever you are
I've already outlived my life by far
Mother of Muses, unleash your wrath
Things I can't see, they're blocking my path
Show me your wisdom, tell me my fate
Put me upright, make me walk straight
Forge my identity from the inside out
You know what I'm talking about
Take me to the river, release your charms
Let me lay down a while in your sweet, loving arms
Wake me, shake me, free me from sin
Make me invisible, like the wind
Got a mind that ramble, got a mind that roam
I'm travelin' light and I'm a-slow coming home"
Motherless Children,Motherless Children,Bob Dylan,"Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead
Motherless children run a hard road, a hard road, a hard road
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead
Your father will do the best he can when your mother is dead
Your father will do the best he can when your mother is dead
Your father will do the best he can, but he just does not understand
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead
Now, there's some people say your sister might do when your mother is dead
Now, there's some people say your sister might do when your mother is dead
Some people say your sister will do; soon as she married, turn her back on you
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead
You can dig my grave with a bloody spade when I'm dead
You can dig my grave with a bloody spade when I'm dead
You can dig my grave with a bloody spade; see that my digger gets well paid
Motherless children run a hard road when your mother is dead
Jesus won't be no mother to you when your mother is dead
Jesus won't be no mother to you when your mother is dead
Jesus won't be no mother to you; his trials and tribulations won't see you through

Motorpsycho Nightmare,Motorpsycho Nightmare,Bob Dylan,"I pounded on a farmhouse
Looking for a place to stay
I was mighty, mighty tired
I'd come a long, long way
I said, “Hey, hey, in there
Is there anybody home?”
I was standin' on the steps
Feeling most alone
When out comes a farmer
He must've thought that I was nuts
He immediate looked at me
And stuck a gun into my guts

I fell down
To my bended knees
Saying, “I dig farmers
Don’t shoot me, please!”
He cocked his rifle
And begin to shout
“Are you that travelin' salesman
That I have heard about”
I said, “No! No! No!
I’m a doctor and it’s true
I’m a clean-cut kid
And I been to college, too”
Then in comes his daughter
Whose name was Rita
She looked like she stepped out of
La Dolce Vita
I immediately tried to cool it
With her dad
And told him what a
Nice, pretty farm he had
He said, “What do doctors
Know about farms, pray tell?”
I said, “I's born
At the bottom of a wishing well”

Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails
I guess he knew I wouldn’t lie
He said “I guess you’re tired”
He said it kind of sly
I said, “Yes, ten thousand miles
Today I drove”
He said, “I got a bed for you
Underneath the stove
Just one condition
You can go to sleep right now
That you don’t touch my daughter
And in the morning, milk the cows”
I was sleeping like a rat
When I heard something jerkin’
There stood Rita
Looking just like Tony Perkins
She said, “Would you like to take a shower?
I’ll show you up to the door”
I said, “Oh, no! no!
I’ve been through this movie before”
I knew I had to split
But I did not know how
When she said
“Would you like to take that shower, now?”

Well, I couldn’t leave
Unless the old man chased me out
Because I’d already promised
That I’d milk his cows
I had to say somethin'
To strike him very weird
So I yelled out
“I like Fidel Castro and his beard”
Rita looked offended
But she got out of the way
As he came charging down the stairs
Sayin', “What’s that I heard you say?”
I said, “I like Fidel Castro
I think you heard me right”
And I ducked as he swung
At me with all his might
Rita mumbled somethin'
'bout her mother on the hill
As his fist it hit the icebox
He said he’s gonna kill me
If I don’t get out the door
In two seconds flat
“You unpatriotic
Rotten doctor Commie rat”

Well, he threw a Reader’s Digest
At my head and I did run
I did a somersault
As I seen him get his gun
And crashed through the window
At a hundred miles an hour
And landed fully blast
In his garden flowers
Rita said, “Come back!”
As he started to load
The sun was coming up
And I was running down the road

Well, I don’t figure I’ll be back
There for a spell
Even though Rita moved away
And got a job in a motel
He still waits for me
Constant, on the sly
He wants to turn me in
To the F.B.I
Me, I romp and stomping
Thankful as I romp
Without freedom of speech
I might be in the swamp"

Mozambique,Mozambique,Bob Dylan,"I like to spend some time in Mozambique
The sunny sky is aqua blue
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek
It’s very nice to stay a week or two
And maybe fall in love, just me and you


There’s lot of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak
To give the special one you seek a chance
Or maybe say hello with just a glance


Lying next to her by the ocean
Reaching out and touching her hand
Whispering your secret emotion
Magic in a magical land

And when it’s time for leaving Mozambique
To say goodbye to sand and sea
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why it’s so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique"
Mr. Bojangles,Mr. Bojangles,Bob Dylan,"I knew a man Bojangles and he'd dance for you in worn out shoes
Silver hair, ragged shirt and baggy pants, that old soft shoe
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he lightly touch down?
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance
I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughing slapped his leg stale
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance
He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick all across the cell
He grabbed his pants for a better stance
Oh, he jumped so high and he clicked up his heels
He let go laugh, he let go laugh, shook back his clothes all around
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance, yeah, dance
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years of how his dog and him
Just traveled about
But his dog up and died, he up and died
And after 20 years he still grieves
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance
He said, ""I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks
For drinks and tips
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars
Because I drinks a bit""
He shook his head, yes, he shook his head
I heard someone ask him, ""Please ...

Mr. Tambourine Man,Mr. Tambourine Man,Bob Dylan,"Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I am branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And my ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancin' spell my way
I promise to go under it
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you"

Murder Most Foul,Murder Most Foul,Bob Dylan,"'Twas a dark day in Dallas, November '63
A day that will live on in infamy
President?Kennedy?was a-ridin' high
Good?day to be livin' and a?good day to die
Being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb
He said, ""Wait a minute, boys, you know who I am?""
""Of course we do, we know who you are""
Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car
Shot down like a dog in broad daylight
Was a matter of timing and the timing was right
You got unpaid debts, we've come to collect
We're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect
We'll mock you and shock you and we'll grin in your face
We've already got someone here to take your place
The day they blew out the brains of the king
Thousands were watching, no one saw a thing
It happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise
Right there in front of everyone's eyes
Greatest magic trick ever under the sun
Perfectly executed, skillfully done
Wolfman, oh Wolfman, oh Wolfman, howl
Rub-a-dub-dub, it's a murder most foul

Hush, little children, you'll understand
The Beatles are comin', they're gonna hold your hand
Slide down the banister, go get your coat
Ferry 'cross the Mersey and go for the throat
There's three bums comin' all dressed in rags
Pick up the pieces and lower the flags
I'm goin' to Woodstock, it's the Aquarian Age
Then I'll go over to Altamont and sit near the stage
Put your head out the window, let the good times roll
There's a party going on behind the Grassy Knoll
Stack up the bricks, pour the cement
Don't say Dallas don't love you, Mr. President
Put your foot in the tank and then step on the gas
Try to make it to the triple underpass
Blackface singer, whiteface clown
Better not show your faces after the sun goes down
Up in the red light district, like a cop on the beat
Living in a nightmare on Elm Street
When you're down on Deep Ellum, put your money in your shoe
Don't ask what your country can do for you
Cash on the barrelhead, money to burn
Dealey Plaza, make a left-hand turn
I'm going down to the crossroads, gonna flag a ride
The place where faith, hope, and charity died
Shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can
See if you can shoot the invisible man
Goodbye, Charlie, goodbye, Uncle Sam
Frankly, Miss Scarlett, I don't give a damn
What is the truth, and where did it go?
Ask Oswald and Ruby, they oughta know
""Shut your mouth,"" said a wise old owl
Business is business, and it's a murder most foul
Tommy, can you hear me? I'm the Acid Queen
I'm riding in a long, black Lincoln limousine
Ridin' in the back seat next to my wife
Headed straight on in to the afterlife
I'm leaning to the left, I got my head in her lap
Oh Lord, I've been led into some kind of a trap
Where we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give
We're right down the street, from the street where you live
They mutilated his body and they took out his brain
What more could they do? They piled on the pain
But his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at
For the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that
Freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me
I hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free
Send me some lovin', then tell me no lie
Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by
Wake up, little Susie, let's go for a drive
Cross the Trinity River, let's keep hope alive
Turn the radio on, don't touch the dials
Parkland Hospital, only six more miles
You got me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead
That magic bullet of yours has gone to my head
I'm just a patsy like Patsy Cline
Never shot anyone from in front or behind
I've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear
I'm never gonna make it to the new frontier
Zapruder's film, I've seen that before
Seen it thirty-three times, maybe more
It's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean
Ugliest thing that you ever have seen
They killed him once and they killed him twice
Killed him like a human sacrifice
The day that they killed him, someone said to me, ""Son
The age of the Antichrist has just only begun""

MusiCares Person of the Year Speech,MusiCares Person of the Year Speech (Ft. Bob Dylan),Bob Dylan,"I'm glad for my songs to be honored like this. But you know, they didn't get here by themselves. It's been a long road and it's taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, they're like mystery stories, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they're on the fringes now. And they sound like they've been on the hard ground
I should mention a few people along the way who brought this about. I know I should mention John Hammond, great talent scout for Columbia Records. He signed me to that label when I was nobody. It took a lot of faith to do that, and he took a lot of ridicule, but he was his own man and he was courageous. And for that, I'm eternally grateful. The last person he discovered before me was Aretha Franklin, and before that Count Basie, Billie Holiday and a whole lot of other artists. All noncommercial artists
Trends did not interest John, and I was very noncommercial but he stayed with me. He believed in my talent and that's all that mattered. I can't thank him enough for that
Lou Levy runs Leeds Music, and they published my earliest songs, but I didn't stay there too long. Levy himself, he went back a long ways. He signed me to that company and recorded my songs and I sang them into a tape recorder. He told me outright, there was no precedent for what I was doing, that I was either before my time or behind it. And if I brought him a song like ""Stardust,"" he'd turn it down because it would be too late
He told me that if I was before my time -- and he didn't really know that for sure -- but if it was happening and if it was true, the public would usually take three to five years to catch up -- so be prepared. And that did happen. The trouble was, when the public did catch up I was already three to five years beyond that, so it kind of complicated it. But he was encouraging, and he didn't judge me, and I'll always remember him for that
Artie Mogull at Witmark Music signed me next to his company, and he told me to just keep writing songs no matter what, that I might be on to something. Well, he too stood behind me, and he could never wait to see what I'd give him next. I didn't even think of myself as a songwriter before then. I'll always be grateful for him also for that attitude
I also have to mention some of the early artists who recorded my songs very, very early, without having to be asked. Just something they felt about them that was right for them. I've got to say thank you to Peter, Paul and Mary, who I knew all separately before they ever became a group. I didn't even think of myself as writing songs for others to sing but it was starting to happen and it couldn't have happened to, or with, a better group
They took a song of mine that had been recorded before that was buried on one of my records and turned it into a hit song. Not the way I would have done it -- they straightened it out. But since then hundreds of people have recorded it and I don't think that would have happened if it wasn't for them. They definitely started something for me
The Byrds, the Turtles, Sonny & Cher -- they made some of my songs Top 10 hits but I wasn't a pop songwriter and I really didn't want to be that, but it was good that it happened. Their versions of songs were like commercials, but I didn't really mind that because 50 years later my songs were being used in the commercials. So that was good too. I was glad it happened, and I was glad they'd done it
Pervis Staples and the Staple Singers -- long before they were on Stax they were on Epic and they were one of my favorite groups of all time. I met them all in '62 or '63. They heard my songs live and Pervis wanted to record three or four of them and he did with the Staples Singers. They were the type of artists that I wanted recording my songs
Nina Simone. I used to cross paths with her in New York City in the Village Gate nightclub. These were the artists I looked up to. She recorded some of my songs that she  to me. She was an overwhelming artist, piano player and singer. Very strong woman, very outspoken. That she was recording my songs validated everything that I was about
Oh, and can't forget Jimi Hendrix. I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform when he was in a band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames -- something like that. And Jimi didn't even sing. He was just the guitar player. He took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and pumped them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere and turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here
Johnny Cash recorded some of my songs early on, too, up in about '63, when he was all skin and bones. He traveled long, he traveled hard, but he was a hero of mine. I heard many of his songs growing up. I knew them better than I knew my own. ""Big River,"" ""I Walk the Line.""
""How high's the water, Mama?"" I wrote ""It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)"" with that song reverberating inside my head. I still ask, ""How high is the water, mama?"" Johnny was an intense character. And he saw that people were putting me down playing electric music, and he posted letters to magazines scolding people, telling them to shut up and let him sing
In Johnny Cash's world -- hardcore Southern drama -- that kind of thing didn't exist. Nobody told anybody what to sing or what not to sing. They just didn't do that kind of thing. I'm always going to thank him for that. Johnny Cash was a giant of a man, the man in black. And I'll always cherish the friendship we had until the day there is no more days
Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Joan Baez. She was the queen of folk music then and now. She took a liking to my songs and brought me with her to play concerts, where she had crowds of thousands of people enthralled with her beauty and voice
People would say, ""What are you doing with that ragtag scrubby little waif?"" And she'd tell everybody in no uncertain terms, ""Now you better be quiet and listen to the songs."" We even played a few of them together. Joan Baez is as tough-minded as they come. Love. And she's a free, independent spirit. Nobody can tell her what to do if she doesn't want to do it. I learned a lot of things from her. A woman with devastating honesty. And for her kind of love and devotion, I could never pay that back

The secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylan's new album
The secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylan's new album
These songs didn't come out of thin air. I didn't just make them up out of whole cloth. Contrary to what Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional music: traditional folk music, traditional rock 'n' roll and traditional big-band swing orchestra music
I learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them back when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me the code for everything that's fair game, that everything belongs to everyone
For three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses, fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one  song and sing it next in an hour if I'd heard it just once

If you sang ""John Henry"" as many times as me -- ""John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer in his hand / John Henry said a man ain't nothin' but a man / Before I let that steam drill drive me down / I'll die with that hammer in my hand.""
If you had sung that song as many times as I did, you'd have written ""How many roads must a man walk down?"" too
Big Bill Broonzy had a song called ""Key to the Highway."" ""I've got a key to the highway / I'm booked and I'm bound to go / Gonna leave here runnin' because walking is most too slow."" I sang that a lot. If you sing that a lot, you just might write
Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department they wouldn’t give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard where can I go
Howard said there’s only one place I know
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
Howard just pointed with his gun
And said that way down on Highway 61
You'd have written that too if you'd sang ""Key to the Highway"" as much as me
""Ain't no use sit 'n cry / You'll be an angel by and by / Sail away, ladies, sail away."" ""I'm sailing away my own true love."" ""Boots of Spanish Leather"" -- Sheryl Crow just sung that
""Roll the cotton down, aw, yeah, roll the cotton down / Ten dollars a day is a white man's pay / A dollar a day is the black man's pay / Roll the cotton down."" If you sang that song as many times as me, you'd be writing ""I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,"" too
I sang a lot of ""come all you"" songs. There's plenty of them. There's way too  many to be counted. ""Come along boys and listen to my tale / Tell you of my trouble on the old Chisholm Trail."" Or, ""Come all ye good people, listen while I tell / the fate of Floyd Collins a lad we all know well / The fate of Floyd Collins, a lad we all know well.""
""Come all ye fair and tender ladies / Take warning how you court your men / They're like a star on a summer morning / They first appear and then they're gone again."" ""If you'll gather 'round, people / A story I will tell /  'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw / Oklahoma knew him well.""
If you sung all these ""come all ye"" songs all the time, you'd be writing, ""Come gather 'round people where ever you roam, admit that the waters around you have grown / Accept that soon you'll be drenched to the bone / If your time to you is worth saving / And you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone / The times they are a-changing.""
You'd have written them too. There's nothing secret about it. You just do it subliminally and unconsciously, because that's all enough, and that's all I sang. That was all that was dear to me. They were the only kinds of songs that made sense
""When you go down to Deep Ellum keep your money in your socks / Women in Deep Ellum put you on the rocks."" Sing that song for a while and you just might come up with, ""When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too / And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through / Don’t put on any airs / When you’re down on Rue Morgue Avenue / They got some hungry women there / And they really make a mess outta you.""
All these songs are connected. Don't be fooled. I just opened up a different door in a different kind of way. It's just different, saying the same thing. I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary
Well you know, I just thought I was doing something natural, but right from the start, my songs were divisive for some reason. They divided people. I never knew why. Some got angered, others loved them. Didn't know why my songs had detractors and supporters. A strange environment to have to throw your songs into, but I did it anyway
Last thing I thought of was who cared about what song I was writing. I was just writing them. I didn't think I was doing anything different. I thought I was just extending the line. Maybe a little bit unruly, but I was just elaborating on situations. Maybe hard to pin down, but so what? A lot of people are hard to pin down. You've just got to bear it. I didn't really care what Lieber and Stoller thought of my songs
They didn't like 'em, but Doc Pomus did. That was all right that they didn't like 'em, because I never liked their songs either. ""Yakety yak, don't talk back."" ""Charlie Brown is a clown,"" ""Baby I'm a hog for you."" Novelty songs. They weren't saying anything serious. Doc's songs, they were better. ""This Magic Moment."" ""Lonely Avenue."" Save the Last Dance for Me
Those songs broke my heart. I figured I'd rather have his blessings any day than theirs
Ahmet Ertegun didn't think much of my songs, but Sam Phillips did. Ahmet founded Atlantic Records. He produced some great records: Ray Charles, Ray Brown, just to name a few
There were some great records in there, no question about it. But Sam Phillips, he recorded Elvis and Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Radical eyes that shook the very essence of humanity. Revolution in style and scope. Heavy shape and color. Radical to the bone. Songs that cut you to the bone. Renegades in all degrees, doing songs that would never decay, and still resound to this day. Oh, yeah, I'd rather have Sam Phillips' blessing any day
Merle Haggard didn't even think much of my songs. I know he didn't. He didn't say that to me, but I know . Buck Owens did, and he recorded some of my early songs. Merle Haggard -- ""Mama Tried,"" ""The Bottle Let Me Down,"" ""I'm a Lonesome Fugitive."" I can't imagine Waylon Jennings singing ""The Bottle Let Me Down.""
""Together Again""? That's Buck Owens, and that trumps anything coming out of Bakersfield. Buck Owens and Merle Haggard? If you have to have somebody's blessing -- you figure it out
Oh, yeah. Critics have been giving me a hard time since Day One. Critics say I can't sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why don't critics say that same thing about Tom Waits? Critics say my voice is shot. That I have no voice. What don't they say those things about Leonard Cohen? Why do I get special treatment? Critics say I can't carry a tune and I talk my way through a song. Really? I've never heard that said about Lou Reed. Why does he get to go scot-free?
Yep. A more gracious way to lament or ""woe is me"" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...
What have I done to deserve this special attention? No vocal range? When's the last time you heard Dr. John? Why don't you say that about him? Slur my words, got no diction. Have you people ever listened to Charley Patton or Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters. Talk about slurred words and no diction.  doesn't even matter
""Why me, Lord?"" I would say that to myself
Critics say I mangle my melodies, render my songs unrecognizable. Oh, really? Let me tell you something. I was at a boxing match a few years ago seeing Floyd Mayweather fight a Puerto Rican guy. And the Puerto Rican national anthem, somebody sang it and it was beautiful. It was heartfelt and it was moving
After that it was time for our national anthem. And a very popular soul-singing sister was chosen to sing. She sang every note -- that exists, and some that don't exist. Talk about mangling a melody. You take a one-syllable word and make it last for 15 minutes? She was doing vocal gymnastics like she was on a trapeze act. But to me it was not funny
Where were the critics? Mangling lyrics? Mangling a melody? Mangling a treasured song? No, I get the blame. But I don't really think I do that. I just think critics say I do
Sam Cooke said this when told he had a beautiful voice: He said, ""Well that's very kind of you, but voices ought not to be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter only if they convince you that they are telling the truth."" Think about that the next time you 
Times always change. They really do. And you have to always be ready for something that's coming along and you never expected it. Way back when, I was in Nashville making some records and I read this article, a Tom T. Hall interview. Tom T. Hall, he was bitching about some kind of new song, and he couldn't understand what these new kinds of songs that were coming in were about
Now Tom, he was one of the most preeminent songwriters of the time in Nashville. A lot of people were recording his songs and he himself even did it. But he was all in a fuss about James Taylor, a song James had called ""Country Road."" Tom was going off in this  interview -- ""But James don't say nothing about a country road. He's just says how you can feel it on the country road. I don't understand that.""
Now some might say Tom is a great songwriter. I'm not going to doubt that. At the time he was doing this interview I was actually listening to a song of his on the radio
It was called ""I Love."" I was listening to it in a recording studio, and he was talking about all the things he loves, an everyman kind of song, trying to connect with people. Trying to make you think that he's just like you and you're just like him. We all love the same things, and we're all in this together. Tom loves little baby ducks, slow-moving trains and rain. He loves old pickup trucks and little country streams. Sleeping without dreams. Bourbon in a glass. Coffee in a cup. Tomatoes on the vine, and onions
Now listen, I'm not ever going to disparage another songwriter. I'm not going to do that. I'm not saying it's a bad song. I'm just saying it might be a little overcooked. But, you know, it was in the top 10 anyway. Tom and a few other writers had the whole Nashville scene sewed up in a box. If you wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go to them, and Tom was one of the top guys. They were all very comfortable, doing their thing
This was about the time that Willie Nelson picked up and moved to Texas. About the same time. He's still in Texas. Everything was very copacetic. Everything was all right until -- until -- Kristofferson came to town. Oh, they ain't seen anybody like him. He came into town like a wildcat, flew his helicopter into Johnny Cash's backyard like a typical songwriter. And he went for the throat. ""Sunday Morning Coming Down.""
Well, I woke up Sunday morning
Grammys 2014: MusiCares gala celebrates the music of Carole King
Grammys 2014: MusiCares gala celebrates the music of Carole King
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet
Found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
You can look at Nashville pre-Kris and post-Kris, because he changed everything. That one song ruined Tom T. Hall's poker parties. It might have sent him to the crazy house. God forbid he ever heard any of my songs
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
You say, “Who is that man?”
You try so hard
But you don’t understand
Just what you're gonna say
When you get home
You know something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is

Do you, Mister Jones?
If ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" rattled Tom's cage, sent him into the looney bin, my song surely would have made him blow his brains out, right there in the minivan. Hopefully he didn't hear it
I just released an album of standards, all the songs usually done by Michael Buble, Harry Connick Jr., maybe Brian Wilson's done a couple, Linda Ronstadt done 'em. But the reviews of their records are different than the reviews of my record
In their reviews no one says anything. In my reviews,  they've got to look under every stone when it comes to me. They've got to mention all the songwriters' names. Well that's OK with me. After all, they're great songwriters and these are standards. I've seen the reviews come in, and they'll mention all the songwriters in half the review, as if everybody knows them. Nobody's heard of them, not in this time, anyway. Buddy Kaye, Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh, to name a few

But, you know, I'm glad they mention their names, and you know what? I'm glad they got their names in the press. It might have taken some time to do it, but they're finally there. I can only wonder why it took so long. My only regret is that they're not here to see it
Traditional rock 'n' roll, we're talking about that. It's all about rhythm. Johnny Cash said it best: ""Get rhythm. Get rhythm when you get the blues."" Very few rock 'n' roll bands today play with rhythm. They don't know what it is. Rock 'n' roll is a combination of blues, and it's a strange thing made up of two parts. A lot of people don't know this, but the blues, which is an American music, is not what you think it is. It's a combination of Arabic violins and Strauss waltzes working it out. But it's true

The other half of rock 'n' roll has got to be hillbilly. And that's a derogatory term, but it ought not to be. That's a term that includes the Delmore Bros., Stanley Bros., Roscoe Holcomb, Clarence Ashley ... groups like that. Moonshiners gone berserk. Fast cars on dirt roads. That's the kind of combination that makes up rock 'n' roll, and it can't be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio
You have to have the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music. If you can't hardly play the blues, how do you  those other two kinds of music in there? You can fake it, but you can't really do it
Critics have made a career out of accusing me of having a career of confounding expectations. Really? Because that's all I do. That's how I think about it. Confounding expectations
""What do you do for a living, man?""
""Oh, I confound expectations.""
You're going to get a job, the man says, ""What do you do?"" ""Oh, confound expectations.: And the man says, ""Well, we already have that spot filled. Call us back. Or don't call us, we'll call you."" Confounding expectations. What does that mean? 'Why me, Lord? I'd confound them, but I don't know how to do it.'
The Blackwood Bros. have been talking to me about making a record together. That might confound expectations, but it shouldn't. Of course it would be a gospel album. I don't think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me. Not a bit. One of the songs I'm thinking about singing is ""Stand By Me"" by the Blackwood Brothers. Not ""Stand By Me"" the pop song. No. The real ""Stand By Me.""
The real one goes like this:
When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the world is tossing me / Like a ship upon the sea / Thou who rulest wind and water / Stand by me
In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / When the hosts of hell assail / And my strength begins to fail / Thou who never lost a battle / Stand by me
In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / When I do the best I can / And my friends don't understand / Thou who knowest all about  me / Stand by me
That's the song. I like it better than the pop song. If I record one by that name, that's going to be the one. I'm also thinking of recording a song, not on that album, though: ""Oh Lord, Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.""
Anyway, why me, Lord. What did I do?
Anyway, I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I'm honored to have all these artists singing my songs. There's nothing like that. Great artists. . They're all singing the truth, and you can hear it in their voices
I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I think a lot of this organization. They've helped many people. Many musicians who have contributed a lot to our culture. I'd like to personally thank them for what they did for a friend of mine, Billy Lee Riley. A friend of mine who they helped for six years when he was down and couldn't work. Billy was a son of rock 'n' roll, obviously

He was a true original. He did it all: He played, he sang, he wrote. He would have been a bigger star but Jerry Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that comes along. You just don't stand a chance
So Billy became what is known in the industry -- a condescending term, by the way -- as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, once in a while, a one-hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star who's got 20 or 30 hits behind him. And Billy's hit song was called ""Red Hot,"" and it was red hot. It could blast you out of your skull and make you feel happy about it. Change your life
He did it with style and grace. You won't find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He's not there. Metallica is. Abba is. Mamas and the Papas -- I know they're in there. Jefferson Airplane, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan -- I've got nothing against them. Soft rock, hard rock, psychedelic pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff, but after all, it is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there. Yet
I'd see him a couple times a year and we'd always spent time together and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit, and we'd cross paths now and again. We'd always spend time together. He was a hero of mine. I'd heard ""Red Hot."" I must have been only 15 or 16 when I did and it's impressed me to this day
Yep. A more gracious way to lament or ""woe is me"" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...
I never grow tired of listening to it. Never got tired of watching Billy Lee perform, either. We spent time together just talking and playing into the night. He was a deep, truthful man. He wasn't bitter or nostalgic. He just accepted it. He knew where he had come from and he was content with who he was
And then one day he got sick. And like my friend John Mellencamp would sing -- because John sang some truth today -- one day you get sick and you don't get better. That's from a song of his called ""Life is Short Even on Its Longest Days."" It's one of the better songs of the last few years, actually. I ain't lying
And I ain't lying when I tell you that MusiCares paid for my friend's doctor bills, and helped him to get spending money. They were able to at least make his life comfortable, tolerable to the end. That is something that can't be repaid. Any organization that would do that would have to have my blessing
I'm going to get out of here now. I'm going to put an egg in my shoe and beat it. I probably left out a lot of people and said too much about some. But that's OK. Like the spiritual song, 'I'm still just crossing over Jordan too.' Let's hope we meet again. Sometime. And we will, if, like Hank Williams said, ""the good Lord willing and the creek don't rise."""

My Back Pages,My Back Pages,Bob Dylan,"Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rolling high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
“We’ll meet on edges, soon,” said I
Proud 'neath heated brow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
“Rip down all hate,” I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

Girls’ faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Un-thought of, though, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

A self-ordained professor’s tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
“Equality,” I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

In a soldier’s stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I’d become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now"
My Blue Eyed Jane,My Blue Eyed Jane,Bob Dylan,"The sweetest girl in the world
Is my blue-eyed Jane
We fell in love like turtledoves
While the moon was shining down
I asked her then, I asked her when
Wedding bells would ring
She said, ""Oh, dear, it seems so queer
That this could happen here.""
You are my little pal
And I never knew a sweeter gal
My little blue-eyed Jane
I love you so
And when the sun goes down
And the shadow's creeping over town
Just meet me in the lane
My blue-eyed Jane
Janie dear, listen here
I've come to say farewell
The world is drear without you, dear
But now I cannot linger here
I'm going away this very day
Oh please, come go with me
I'll be sad and blue wanting you
Longing all day through
My little blue-eyed Jane
You'll always be the same sweet thing
I know you'll never change
I love you so
And when the sun goes down
And the shadow's creeping over town
Then I'll come back again
My blue-eyed Jane
And when the sun goes down
And the shadow's creeping over town
Then I'll come back again

You 're going through my eyes
While the water floats Now
I dream about your hair
I think I walk

Or when I cry wolf
Whether I'm alive
I do not know
Because you are my golden age
You're my air"
My One and Only Love,My One and Only Love,Bob Dylan,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring
And you appear in all your splendor
My one and only love
The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips so warm and tender
My one and only love
The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
And the blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own
You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love
The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
And the blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own
You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love"
My Own Version of You,My Own Version of You,Bob Dylan,"All through the summers, into January
I've been visiting morgues and monasteries
Looking for the necessary body?parts
Limbs?and livers and?brains and hearts
I'll bring someone to?life, is what I wanna do
I wanna create my own?version?of?you
Well, it must?be the winter?of my discontent
I wish you'd've taken me with you wherever you went
They talk all night and they talk all day
Not for a minute do I believe anything they say
I'm gon' bring someone to life, someone I've never seen
You know what I mean, you know exactly what I mean
I'll take the Scarface Pacino and The Godfather Brando
Mix it up in a tank and get a robot commando
If I do it up right and put the head on straight
I'll be saved by the creature that I create
I'll get blood from a cactus, gunpowder from ice
I don't gamble with cards and I don't shoot no dice
Can you look at my face with your sightless eyes?
Can you cross your heart and hope to die?
I'll bring someone to life, someone for real
Someone who feels the way that I feel
I study Sanskrit and Arabic to improve my mind
I wanna do things for the benefit of all mankind
I say to the willow tree, ""Don't weep for me""
I'm saying to hell to all things that I used to be
Well, I get into trouble, then I hit the wall
No place to turn, no place at all
I'll pick a number between a-one and two
And I ask myself, ""What would Julius Caesar do?""
I will bring someone to life in more ways than one
Don't matter how long it takes, it'll be done when it's done
I'm gonna make you play the piano like Leon Russell
Like Liberace, like St. John the Apostle
I'll play every number that I can play
I'll see you maybe on Judgment Day
After midnight, if you still wanna meet
I'll be at the Black Horse Tavern on Armageddon Street
Two doors down, not that far to walk
I'll hear your footsteps, you won't have to knock
I'll bring someone to life, balance the scales
I'm not gonna get involved any insignificant details
You can bring it to St. Peter
You can bring it to Jerome
You can bring it all the way over
Bring it all the way home
Bring it to the corner where the children play
You can bring it to me on a silver tray
I'll bring someone to life, spare no expense
Do it with decency and common sense
Can you tell me what it means, to be or not to be?
You won't get away with fooling me
Can you help me walk that moonlight mile?
Can you give me the blessings of your smile?
I'll bring someone to life, use all of my powers
Do it in the dark, in the wee, small hours
I can see the history of the whole human race
It's all right there, it's carved into your face
Should I break it all down? Should I fall on my knees?
Is there light at the end of the tunnel, can you tell me, please?
Stand over there by the cypress tree
Where the Trojan women and children were sold into slavery
Long before the first Crusade
Way back before England or America were made
Step right into the burning hell
Where some of the best-known enemies of mankind dwell
Mr. Freud with his dreams, Mr. Marx with his ax
See the raw hide lash rip the skin from their backs
Got the right spirit, you can feel it, you can hear it
You've got what they call the immortal spirit
You can feel it all night, you can feel it in the morn'
It creeps in your body the day you were born
One strike of lightning is all that I need
And a blast of electricity that runs at top speed
Show me your ribs, I'll stick in the knife
Gonna jumpstart my creation to life
I wanna bring someone to life, turn back the years
Do it with laughter and do it with tears"
My Wife’s Home Town,My Wife's Home Town,Bob Dylan,"Well I didn't come here to deal with a dog gone thing
I just came here to hear the drummer's cymbal ring
There is no way you can put me down
I just want to say that Hell's my wife's home town

Well there's reasons for that and reasons for this
I can't think of any just now, but I know they exist
I'm sitting in the sun till my skin turns brown
I just want to say that Hell's my wife's home town
Home town, home town

She can make you steal, make you rob
Give you the hives, make you lose your job
Make things bad, she can make things worse
She got stuff more potent than a gypsy curse

One of these days, I'll end up on the run
I'm pretty sure, she'll make me kill someone
I'm going inside, roll the shutters down
I just want to say that Hell's my wife's home town

Well there's plenty to remember, plenty to forget
I still can remember the day we met
I lost my reason long ago
My love for her is all I know
State gone broke, the county's dry
Don't be looking at me, with that evil eye
Keep on walking don't be hanging around
I'm telling you again that Hell's my wife's home town
Home town, home town"
Naomi Wise,Naomi Wise,Bob Dylan,"Well she met him as she promised
Up at Adam's this spring
Expecting some money
Or some other fine thing
No money, no money
To flatter the case
""We'll have to get married
So there'll be no disgrace.""
""So jump you up Omie
And away we will ride
To yonder fair country
Where the cool waters glide.""
She jumped up behind him
And away they did ride
To yonder fair country
Where the deep waters glide
""Now jump you down Omie
And i'll tell you my mind
My mind is to drown you
And to leave you behind.""
She begged and she pleaded
""Oh, don't take my life
And i will deny you
And i'll never be your wife.""
There she kicked and he cuffed her
To the worst understand
And he threw her in deep water
That flows through the land
They found her poor body
The following day
The preacher and the reverend
Lord, they all begun to pray
And up spoke her mother
With a voice so a-sting
""Nobody but John Lewis
Could've done such a thing.""
They traced him up the waters
To Dutch Charlie's Bend
Where they found him in jail
For killin' a man
""Go hang him, go hang him.""
Was that mother's command
""And throw him in deep waters
That flows through the land."""
Narrow Way,Narrow Way,Bob Dylan,"I'm gonna walk across the desert 'til I'm in my right mind
I won't even think about what I left behind
Nothing back there anyway that I can call my own
Go back home, leave me alone
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Ever since the British burned the White House down
There's a bleeding wound in the heart of town
I saw you drinking from an empty cup
I saw you buried and I saw you dug up
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Look down angel from the skies
Help my weary soul to rise
I kissed her cheek I dragged your plow
You broke my heart, I was your friend 'til now
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

In the courtyard of the golden sun
You stand and fight or you break and run
You went and lost your lovely head
For a drink of wine and a crust of bread
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
We looted and we plundered on distant shores
Why is my share not equal to yours
Your father left you, your mother too
Even death has washed its hands of you
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

This is hard country to stay alive in
Blades are everywhere and they're breaking my skin
I'm armed to the hilt and I'm struggling hard
You won't get out of here unscarred
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

You got too many lovers waiting at the wall
If I had a thousand tongues, I couldn't count them all
Yesterday I could've thrown them all in the sea
Today, even one, may be too much for me
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Can't walk them, baby, you could do no wrong
Put your arms around me, where they belong
I won't take you on a roller-coaster ride
Lay my hands all over you, tie you to my side
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
I've got a heavy stacked woman with a smile on her face
And she has crowned my soul with grace
Im still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest
I'm gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Been dark all night but now it's dawn
The moving finger is moving on
You can guard me while I sleep
Kiss away the tears I weep
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

I love women and she loves men
We've been to the west and we going back again
I heard a voice at the dusk of day
Saying, ""Be gentle brother, be gentle and pray.""
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday"
Need a Woman,Need a Woman,Bob Dylan,"Lately I've been having evil dreams
I wake up in a cold blue glare
I run the tape back in my mind
Wonder if I took the wrong road somewhere
Searching for the truth the way God designed it
Well the real truth is that I might be afraid to find it

Well, I need a woman, alright
Need a woman, every night
To be with me and know me as I am
Show me the kind of love that don't have to be condemned
And I want you to be that woman every day
Be that woman every way

Well I've had my eyes on you baby for five long years
Well you probably don't know me at all
But I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears
A tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near
There's always some new stranger in the night
To lend a sympathetic ear

Well I need a woman to be my own
I need a woman that's mine alone
Seen you in the doorway, I seen you in the park
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark
And I want you to be that woman oh oh oh
Be that woman every way
You keep listening to something long enough
You just bound to believe that it's true
You know there's some things that you put out
It's gonna come back on you
That which is not permanent don't last
Whatever's waiting in the future
Could be what you're running from in the past

Well I need a woman, oh pull up
Need a woman, drinking from the same cup
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend
Someone who don't make herself up to make every man her friend
And I want you to be that woman every day
Be that woman every way

Don't know what you got that I want
Don't know what I got to give
Don't know how much time I've got
Don't know how long I'll live
The rebellion in my soul, why was it created?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep me isolated

But I need a woman, she ain't no crime
Need a woman, all the time
To see the promised land with me as the time goes by
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high
And I want you to be that woman, yes I do
Be that woman straight and true"
Neighborhood Bully,Neighborhood Bully,Bob Dylan,"Well, the neighborhood bully, he’s just one man
His enemies say he’s on their land
They got him outnumbered about a million to one
He got no place to escape to, no place to run
He’s the neighborhood bully

The neighborhood bully just lives to survive
He’s criticized and condemned for being alive
He’s not supposed to fight back, he’s supposed to have thick skin
He’s supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in
He’s the neighborhood bully

The neighborhood bully been driven out of every land
He’s wandered the earth an exiled man
Seen his family scattered, his people hounded and torn
He’s always on trial for just being born
He’s the neighborhood bully

Well, he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, nobody was glad
The bombs were meant for him. He was supposed to feel bad
He’s the neighborhood bully
Well, the chances are against it and the odds are slim
That he’ll live by the rules that the world makes for him
Because there’s a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
And a license to kill him is given out to every maniac
He’s the neighborhood bully

He got no allies to really speak of
What he gets he must pay for, he don’t get it out of love
He buys obsolete weapons and he won’t be denied
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side
He’s the neighborhood bully

Well, he’s surrounded by pacifists who all want peace
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease
Now, they wouldn’t hurt a fly. To hurt one they would weep
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep
He’s the neighborhood bully

Every empire that’s enslaved him is gone
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon
He’s made a garden of paradise in the desert sand
In bed with nobody, under no one’s command
He’s the neighborhood bully
Now his holiest books have been trampled upon
No contract he signed was worth what it was written on
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health
He’s the neighborhood bully

What’s anybody indebted to him for?
Nothing, they say. He just likes to cause war
Pride and prejudice and superstition indeed
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed
He’s the neighborhood bully

What has he done to wear so many scars?
Does he change the course of rivers? Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Neighborhood bully, standing on the hill
Running out the clock, time standing still
Neighborhood bully"
Nettie Moore,Nettie Moore,Bob Dylan,"Lost John sitting on a railroad track
Something's out of whack
Blues this morning falling down like hail
Gonna leave a greasy trail

Gonna travel the world is what I'm gonna do
Then come back and see you
All I ever do is struggle and strive
If I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive

I'm the oldest son of a crazy man
I'm in a cowboy band
Got a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hide
I'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other side

Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes
The world of research has gone berserk
Too much paperwork
Albert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hell
I'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell

I'm going where the Southern crosses the Yellow Dog
Get away from these demagogues
And these bad luck women stick like glue
It's either one or the other or neither of the two

She says, ""look out daddy, don't want you to tear your pants
You can get wrecked in this dance.""
They say whiskey will kill ya, but I don't think it will
I'm riding with you to the top of the hill

Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes
Don't know why my baby never looked so good before
I don't have to wonder no more
She been cooking all day and it's gonna take me all night
I can't eat all that stuff in a single bite

The Judge is coming in, everybody rise
Lift up your eyes
You can do what you please, you don't need my advice
Before you call me any dirty names you better think twice

Getting light outside, the temperature dropped
I think the rain has stopped
I'm going to make you come to grips with fate
When I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight

Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes
The bright spark of the steady lights
Has dimmed my sights
When you're around all my grief gives 'way
A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day

Everything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrong
I'll be drifting along
The woman I'm a-loving, she rules my heart
No knife could ever cut our love apart

Today I'll stand in faith and raise
The voice of praise
The sun is strong, I'm standing in the light
I wish to God that it were night

Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes"
Never Gonna Be the Same Again,Never Gonna Be the Same Again,Bob Dylan,"Now you’re here beside me, baby
You’re a living dream
And every time you get this close
It makes me want to scream
You touched me and you knew
That I was warm for you and then
I am never going to be the same again

Sorry if I hurt you, baby
Sorry if I did
Sorry if I touched the place
Where your secrets are hid
But you meant more than everything
And I could not pretend
I am never going to be the same again

You give me something to think about, baby
Every time I see you
Don’t worry, baby, I don’t mind leaving
I’d just like it to be my idea

You taught me how to love you, baby
You taught me, oh, so well
Now, I can’t go back to what was, baby
I can’t unring the bell
You took my reality
And cast it to the wind
And I am not going to be the same again"
Never Say Goodbye,Never Say Goodbye,Bob Dylan,"Twilight on the frozen lake
North wind about to break
On footprints in the snow
Silence down below

You’re beautiful beyond words
You’re beautiful to me
You can make me cry
Never say goodbye

Time is all I have to give
You can have it if you choose
With me you can live
Never say goodbye

My dreams are made of iron and steel
With a big bouquet
Of roses hanging down
From the heavens to the ground

The crashing waves roll over me
As I stand upon the sand
Wait for you to come
And grab hold of my hand
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue
You’ll change your last name, too
You’ve turned your hair to brown
Love to see it hanging’ down"
Nevertheless,Nevertheless,Bob Dylan,"Maybe I'm right and maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak and maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win and maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Somehow, I know at a glance
The terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start
Then left with a heart that is breaking
Maybe I'll live the life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll live the life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get
But nevertheless I'm in love with you"
New Morning,New Morning,Bob Dylan,"Can’t you hear that rooster crowing?
Rabbit running down across the road
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

Can’t you hear that motor turning?
Automobile coming into style
Coming down the road for a country mile or two
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

The night passed away so quickly
It always does when you’re with me

Can’t you feel that sun a-shining?
Ground hog running by the country stream
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true
So happy just to be alive
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you
So happy just to be alive
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you
New morning"
New Pony,New Pony,Bob Dylan,"I had a pony, her name was Lucifer
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer
She broke her leg and needed shooting
I swear it hurt me more than it could ever have hurted her

Sometimes I wonder what’s going on with Miss X
Sometimes I wonder what’s going on with Miss X
She got such a sweet disposition
I never know what the poor girl’s gonna do to me next

I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace
She got great big hind legs, long black shaggy hair hanging in her face


Everybody says you’re using’ voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves
Oh well, everybody says you’re using’ voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves
Oh, baby, that god you been prayin’ to
Gonna given you back what you’re wishing’ on someone else

Come over here pony, I wanna climb up one time on you
You’re oh so nasty and so bad  I swear I love you yes I do"
Night After Night,Night After Night,Bob Dylan,"Night after night, you wander the streets of my mind
Night after night, don't know what you think you will find
No place to go, nowhere to turn
Everything around you seems to burn, burn, burn
And there's never any mercy in sight, night after night
Night after night
Night after night
Night after night, some new plan to blow up the world
Night after night, another old man kissing some young girl
You look for salvation, you find none
Just another broken heart, another barrel of a gun
Just another stick of dynamite, night after night
Night after night
Night after night
Night after night, you drop dead in your bed
Night after night, another bottle finds a head
Night after night, I think about cutting you loose
But I just can't do it, what would be the use?
So I just keep a-holding you tight, night after night
Night after night after night after night after night
Night after night after night after night after night
Night after night after night after night after night
Night after night after night after night after night"
Ninety Miles an Hour (Down a Dead End Street),Ninety Miles an Hour (Down a Dead End Street),Bob Dylan,"I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done
Instead of stopping when we could we went right on
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone

You belong to someone else, and I do too
It's just crazy bein' here with you
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street

I didn't want to want you, but now I have no choice
It's too late to listen to that warning voice
All I hear is thunder of two hearts beat
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street

You're not free to belong to me
And you know I could never be your own
Your lips on mine are like a sweet, sweet wine
But we're heading for a wall of stone
Warning signs are flashing every where, but we pay no heed
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a picking up speed
Disaster's getting closer every time we meet
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street"

No Time to Think,No Time to Think,Bob Dylan,"In death, you face life with a child and a wife
Who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls
You’re a soldier of mercy, you’re cold and you curse
“He who cannot be trusted must fall”

Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety
You fight for the throne and you travel alone
Unknown as you slowly sink
And there’s no time to think

In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity
In secret, for pieces of change
The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you
And it makes you feel violent and strange

Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss
In the valley of the missing link
And you have no time to think

Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you
Her worst is better than best
I’ve seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes
And I feel so depressed
China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you
Like the plague, with a dangerous wink
And there’s no time to think

Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you
Where the lion lies down with the lamb
I’d have paid off the traitor and killed him much later
But that’s just the way that I am

Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality
But the magician is quicker and his game
Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
And there’s no time to think

Anger and jealousy’s all that he sells us
He’s content when you’re under his thumb
Madmen oppose him, but your kindness throws him
To survive it you play deaf and dumb

Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity
You glance through the mirror and there’s eyes staring clear
At the back of your head as you drink
And there’s no time to think
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow
Will offer their heads for a prayer
You can’t find no salvation, you have no expectations
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere

Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility
You know you can’t keep her and the water gets deeper
That is leading you onto the brink
But there’s no time to think

You’ve murdered your vanity, buried your sanity
For pleasure you must now resist
Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you
They’re not even sure you exist

Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws
And the sound of the keys as they clink
But there’s no time to think

The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl
With the rose in her hair
Starlight in the East and you’re finally released
You’re stranded but with nothing to share
Loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille
’Neath the moon shining’ bloody and pink
And there’s no time to think

Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you
But no, you will not be deceived
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt
You can give but you cannot receive

No time to choose when the truth must die
No time to lose or say goodbye
No time to prepare for the victim that’s there
No time to suffer or blink
And no time to think"
Nobel Prize Lecture in Literature (2017),Nobel Prize Lecture in Literature (2017),Bob Dylan,"When I first received this Nobel Prize for Literature, I got to wondering exactly how my songs related to literature. I wanted to reflect on it and see where the connection was. I'm going to try to articulate that to you. And most likely it will go in a roundabout way, but I hope what I say will be worthwhile and purposeful.
If I was to go back to the dawning of it all, I guess I'd have to start with Buddy Holly. Buddy died when I was about eighteen and he was twenty-two. From the moment I first heard him, I felt akin. I felt related, like he was an older brother. I even thought I resembled him. Buddy played the music that I loved – the music I grew up on: country western, rock ‘n' roll, and rhythm and blues. Three separate strands of music that he intertwined and infused into one genre. One brand. And Buddy wrote songs – songs that had beautiful melodies and imaginative verses. And he sang great – sang in more than a few voices. He was the archetype. Everything I wasn't and wanted to be. I saw him only but once, and that was a few days before he was gone. I had to travel a hundred miles to get to see him play, and I wasn't disappointed.
He was powerful and electrifying and had a commanding presence. I was only six feet away. He was mesmerizing. I watched his face, his hands, the way he tapped his foot, his big black glasses, the eyes behind the glasses, the way he held his guitar, the way he stood, his neat suit. Everything about him. He looked older than twenty-two. Something about him seemed permanent, and he filled me with conviction. Then, out of the blue, the most uncanny thing happened. He looked me right straight dead in the eye, and he transmitted something. Something I didn't know what. And it gave me the chills.
I think it was a day or two after that that his plane went down. And somebody – somebody I'd never seen before – handed me a Leadbelly record with the song ""Cottonfields"" on it. And that record changed my life right then and there. Transported me into a world I'd never known. It was like an explosion went off. Like I'd been walking in darkness and all of the sudden the darkness was illuminated. It was like somebody laid hands on me. I must have played that record a hundred times.
It was on a label I'd never heard of with a booklet inside with advertisements for other artists on the label: Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, the New Lost City Ramblers, Jean Ritchie, string bands. I'd never heard of any of them. But I reckoned if they were on this label with Leadbelly, they had to be good, so I needed to hear them. I wanted to know all about it and play that kind of music. I still had a feeling for the music I'd grown up with, but for right now, I forgot about it. Didn't even think about it. For the time being, it was long gone.
I hadn't left home yet, but I couldn't wait to. I wanted to learn this music and meet the people who played it. Eventually, I did leave, and I did learn to play those songs. They were different than the radio songs that I'd been listening to all along. They were more vibrant and truthful to life. With radio songs, a performer might get a hit with a roll of the dice or a fall of the cards, but that didn't matter in the folk world. Everything was a hit. All you had to do was be well versed and be able to play the melody. Some of these songs were easy, some not. I had a natural feeling for the ancient ballads and country blues, but everything else I had to learn from scratch. I was playing for small crowds, sometimes no more than four or five people in a room or on a street corner. You had to have a wide repertoire, and you had to know what to play and when. Some songs were intimate, some you had to shout to be heard.
By listening to all the early folk artists and singing the songs yourself, you pick up the vernacular. You internalize it. You sing it in the ragtime blues, work songs, Georgia sea shanties, Appalachian ballads and cowboy songs. You hear all the finer points, and you learn the details.
You know what it's all about. Takin' the pistol out and puttin' it back in your pocket. Whippin' your way through traffic, talkin' in the dark. You know that Stagger Lee was a bad man and that Frankie was a good girl. You know that Washington is a bourgeois town and you've heard the deep-pitched voice of John the Revelator and you saw the Titanic sink in a boggy creek. And you're pals with the wild Irish rover and the wild colonial boy. You heard the muffled drums and the fifes that played lowly. You've seen the lusty Lord Donald stick a knife in his wife, and a lot of your comrades have been wrapped in white linen.
I had all the vernacular down. I knew the rhetoric. None of it went over my head – the devices, the techniques, the secrets, the mysteries – and I knew all the deserted roads that it traveled on, too. I could make it all connect and move with the current of the day. When I started writing my own songs, the folk lingo was the only vocabulary that I knew, and I used it.
But I had something else as well. I had principles and sensibilities and an informed view of the world. And I had had that for a while. Learned it all in grammar school. Don Quixote, Ivanhoe, Robinson Crusoe, Gulliver's Travels, Tale of Two Cities, all the rest – typical grammar school reading that gave you a way of looking at life, an understanding of human nature, and a standard to measure things by. I took all that with me when I started composing lyrics. And the themes from those books worked their way into many of my songs, either knowingly or unintentionally. I wanted to write songs unlike anything anybody ever heard, and these themes were fundamental.
Specific books that have stuck with me ever since I read them way back in grammar school – I want to tell you about three of them: Moby Dick, All Quiet on the Western Front and The Odyssey.

Moby Dick is a fascinating book, a book that's filled with scenes of high drama and dramatic dialogue. The book makes demands on you. The plot is straightforward. The mysterious Captain Ahab – captain of a ship called the Pequod –  an egomaniac with a peg leg pursuing his nemesis, the great white whale Moby Dick who took his leg. And he pursues him all the way from the Atlantic around the tip of Africa and into the Indian Ocean. He pursues the whale around both sides of the earth. It's an abstract goal, nothing concrete or definite. He calls Moby the emperor, sees him as the embodiment of evil. Ahab's got a wife and child back in Nantucket that he reminisces about now and again. You can anticipate what will happen.
The ship's crew is made up of men of different races, and any one of them who sights the whale will be given the reward of a gold coin. A lot of Zodiac symbols, religious allegory, stereotypes. Ahab encounters other whaling vessels, presses the captains for details about Moby. Have they seen him? There's a crazy prophet, Gabriel, on one of the vessels, and he predicts Ahab's doom. Says Moby is the incarnate of a Shaker god, and that any dealings with him will lead to disaster. He says that to Captain Ahab. Another ship's captain – Captain Boomer – he lost an arm to Moby. But he tolerates that, and he's happy to have survived. He can't accept Ahab's lust for vengeance.
This book tells how different men react in different ways to the same experience. A lot of Old Testament, biblical allegory: Gabriel, Rachel, Jeroboam, Bildah, Elijah. Pagan names as well: Tashtego, Flask, Daggoo, Fleece, Starbuck, Stubb, Martha's Vineyard. The Pagans are idol worshippers. Some worship little wax figures, some wooden figures. Some worship fire. The Pequod is the name of an Indian tribe.
Moby Dick is a seafaring tale. One of the men, the narrator, says, ""Call me Ishmael."" Somebody asks him where he's from, and he says, ""It's not down on any map. True places never are."" Stubb gives no significance to anything, says everything is predestined. Ishmael's been on a sailing ship his entire life. Calls the sailing ships his Harvard and Yale. He keeps his distance from people.
A typhoon hits the Pequod. Captain Ahab thinks it's a good omen. Starbuck thinks it's a bad omen, considers killing Ahab. As soon as the storm ends, a crewmember falls from the ship's mast and drowns, foreshadowing what's to come. A Quaker pacifist priest, who is actually a bloodthirsty businessman, tells Flask, ""Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness.""
Everything is mixed in. All the myths: the Judeo Christian bible, Hindu myths, British legends, Saint George, Perseus, Hercules – they're all whalers. Greek mythology, the gory business of cutting up a whale. Lots of facts in this book, geographical knowledge, whale oil – good for coronation of royalty – noble families in the whaling industry. Whale oil is used to anoint the kings. History of the whale, phrenology, classical philosophy, pseudo-scientific theories, justification for discrimination – everything thrown in and none of it hardly rational. Highbrow, lowbrow, chasing illusion, chasing death, the great white whale, white as polar bear, white as a white man, the emperor, the nemesis, the embodiment of evil. The demented captain who actually lost his leg years ago trying to attack Moby with a knife.
We see only the surface of things. We can interpret what lies below any way we see fit. Crewmen walk around on deck listening for mermaids, and sharks and vultures follow the ship. Reading skulls and faces like you read a book. Here's a face. I'll put it in front of you. Read it if you can.
Tashtego says that he died and was reborn. His extra days are a gift. He wasn't saved by Christ, though, he says he was saved by a fellow man and a non-Christian at that. He parodies the resurrection.
When Starbuck tells Ahab that he should let bygones be bygones, the angry captain snaps back, ""Speak not to me of blasphemy, man, I'd strike the sun if it insulted me."" Ahab, too, is a poet of eloquence. He says, ""The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails whereon my soul is grooved to run.""  Or these lines, ""All visible objects are but pasteboard masks."" Quotable poetic phrases that can't be beat.
Finally, Ahab spots Moby, and the harpoons come out. Boats are lowered. Ahab's harpoon has been baptized in blood. Moby attacks Ahab's boat and destroys it. Next day, he sights Moby again. Boats are lowered again. Moby attacks Ahab's boat again. On the third day, another boat goes in. More religious allegory. He has risen. Moby attacks one more time, ramming the Pequod and sinking it. Ahab gets tangled up in the harpoon lines and is thrown out of his boat into a watery grave.
Ishmael survives. He's in the sea floating on a coffin. And that's about it. That's the whole story. That theme and all that it implies would work its way into more than a few of my songs.

All Quiet on the Western Front was another book that did. All Quiet on the Western Front is a horror story. This is a book where you lose your childhood, your faith in a meaningful world, and your concern for individuals. You're stuck in a nightmare. Sucked up into a mysterious whirlpool of death and pain. You're defending yourself from elimination. You're being wiped off the face of the map. Once upon a time you were an innocent youth with big dreams about being a concert pianist. Once you loved life and the world, and now you're shooting it to pieces.
Day after day, the hornets bite you and worms lap your blood. You're a cornered animal. You don't fit anywhere. The falling rain is monotonous. There's endless assaults, poison gas, nerve gas, morphine, burning streams of gasoline, scavenging and scabbing for food, influenza, typhus, dysentery. Life is breaking down all around you, and the shells are whistling. This is the lower region of hell. Mud, barbed wire, rat-filled trenches, rats eating the intestines of dead men, trenches filled with filth and excrement. Someone shouts, ""Hey, you there. Stand and fight.""
Who knows how long this mess will go on? Warfare has no limits. You're being annihilated, and that leg of yours is bleeding too much. You killed a man yesterday, and you spoke to his corpse. You told him after this is over, you'll spend the rest of your life looking after his family. Who's profiting here? The leaders and the generals gain fame, and many others profit financially. But you're doing the dirty work. One of your comrades says, ""Wait a minute, where are you going?"" And you say, ""Leave me alone, I'll be back in a minute."" Then you walk out into the woods of death hunting for a piece of sausage. You can't see how anybody in civilian life has any kind of purpose at all. All their worries, all their desires – you can't comprehend it.
More machine guns rattle, more parts of bodies hanging from wires, more pieces of arms and legs and skulls where butterflies perch on teeth, more hideous wounds, pus coming out of every pore, lung wounds, wounds too big for the body, gas-blowing cadavers, and dead bodies making retching noises. Death is everywhere. Nothing else is possible. Someone will kill you and use your dead body for target practice. Boots, too. They're your prized possession. But soon they'll be on somebody else's feet.
There's Froggies coming through the trees. Merciless bastards. Your shells are running out. ""It's not fair to come at us again so soon,"" you say. One of your companions is laying in the dirt, and you want to take him to the field hospital. Someone else says, ""You might save yourself a trip."" ""What do you mean?"" ""Turn him over, you'll see what I mean.""
You wait to hear the news. You don't understand why the war isn't over. The army is so strapped for replacement troops that they're drafting young boys who are of little military use, but they're draftin' ‘em anyway because they're running out of men. Sickness and humiliation have broken your heart. You were betrayed by your parents, your schoolmasters, your ministers, and even your own government.
The general with the slowly smoked cigar betrayed you too – turned you into a thug and a murderer. If you could, you'd put a bullet in his face. The commander as well. You fantasize that if you had the money, you'd put up a reward for any man who would take his life by any means necessary. And if he should lose his life by doing that, then let the money go to his heirs. The colonel, too, with his caviar and his coffee – he's another one. Spends all his time in the officers' brothel. You'd like to see him stoned dead too. More Tommies and Johnnies with their whack fo' me daddy-o and their whiskey in the jars. You kill twenty of ‘em and twenty more will spring up in their place. It just stinks in your nostrils.
You've come to despise that older generation that sent you out into this madness, into this torture chamber. All around you, your comrades are dying. Dying from abdominal wounds, double amputations, shattered hipbones, and you think, ""I'm only twenty years old, but I'm capable of killing anybody. Even my father if he came at me.""
Yesterday, you tried to save a wounded messenger dog, and somebody shouted, ""Don't be a fool."" One Froggy is laying gurgling at your feet. You stuck him with a dagger in his stomach, but the man still lives. You know you should finish the job, but you can't. You're on the real iron cross, and a Roman soldier's putting a sponge of vinegar to your lips.
Months pass by. You go home on leave. You can't communicate with your father. He said, ""You'd be a coward if you don't enlist."" Your mother, too, on your way back out the door, she says, ""You be careful of those French girls now."" More madness. You fight for a week or a month, and you gain ten yards. And then the next month it gets taken back.
All that culture from a thousand years ago, that philosophy, that wisdom – Plato, Aristotle, Socrates – what happened to it?  It should have prevented this. Your thoughts turn homeward. And once again you're a schoolboy walking through the tall poplar trees. It's a pleasant memory. More bombs dropping on you from blimps. You got to get it together now. You can't even look at anybody for fear of some miscalculable thing that might happen. The common grave. There are no other possibilities.
Then you notice the cherry blossoms, and you see that nature is unaffected by all this. Poplar trees, the red butterflies, the fragile beauty of flowers, the sun – you see how nature is indifferent to it all. All the violence and suffering of all mankind. Nature doesn't even notice it.
You're so alone. Then a piece of shrapnel hits the side of your head and you're dead.
You've been ruled out, crossed out. You've been exterminated. I put this book down and closed it up. I never wanted to read another war novel again, and I never did.
Charlie Poole from North Carolina had a song that connected to all this. It's called ""You Ain't Talkin' to Me,"" and the lyrics go like this:
I saw a sign in a window walking up town one day.
Join the army, see the world is what it had to say.
You'll see exciting places with a jolly crew,
You'll meet interesting people, and learn to kill them too.
Oh you ain't talkin' to me, you ain't talking to me.
I may be crazy and all that, but I got good sense you see.
You ain't talkin' to me, you ain't talkin' to me.
Killin' with a gun don't sound like fun.
You ain't talkin' to me.
The Odyssey is a great book whose themes have worked its way into the ballads of a lot of songwriters: ""Homeward Bound, ""Green, Green Grass of Home,"" ""Home on the Range,"" and my songs as well.
The Odyssey is a strange, adventurous tale of a grown man trying to get home after fighting in a war. He's on that long journey home, and it's filled with traps and pitfalls. He's cursed to wander. He's always getting carried out to sea, always having close calls. Huge chunks of boulders rock his boat. He angers people he shouldn't. There's troublemakers in his crew. Treachery. His men are turned into pigs and then are turned back into younger, more handsome men. He's always trying to rescue somebody. He's a travelin' man, but he's making a lot of stops.
He's stranded on a desert island. He finds deserted caves, and he hides in them. He meets giants that say, ""I'll eat you last."" And he escapes from giants. He's trying to get back home, but he's tossed and turned by the winds. Restless winds, chilly winds, unfriendly winds. He travels far, and then he gets blown back.
He's always being warned of things to come. Touching things he's told not to. There's two roads to take, and they're both bad. Both hazardous. On one you could drown and on the other you could starve. He goes into the narrow straits with foaming whirlpools that swallow him. Meets six-headed monsters with sharp fangs. Thunderbolts strike at him. Overhanging branches that he makes a leap to reach for to save himself from a raging river. Goddesses and gods protect him, but some others want to kill him. He changes identities. He's exhausted. He falls asleep, and he's woken up by the sound of laughter. He tells his story to strangers. He's been gone twenty years. He was carried off somewhere and left there. Drugs have been dropped into his wine. It's been a hard road to travel.
In a lot of ways, some of these same things have happened to you. You too have had drugs dropped into your wine. You too have shared a bed with the wrong woman. You too have been spellbound by magical voices, sweet voices with strange melodies. You too have come so far and have been so far blown back. And you've had close calls as well. You have angered people you should not have. And you too have rambled this country all around. And you've also felt that ill wind, the one that blows you no good. And that's still not all of it.
When he gets back home, things aren't any better. Scoundrels have moved in and are taking advantage of his wife's hospitality. And there's too many of ‘em. And though he's greater than them all and the best at everything – best carpenter, best hunter, best expert on animals, best seaman – his courage won't save him, but his trickery will.
All these stragglers will have to pay for desecrating his palace. He'll disguise himself as a filthy beggar, and a lowly servant kicks him down the steps with arrogance and stupidity. The servant's arrogance revolts him, but he controls his anger. He's one against a hundred, but they'll all fall, even the strongest. He was nobody. And when it's all said and done, when he's home at last, he sits with his wife, and he tells her the stories.
***
So what does it all mean? Myself and a lot of other songwriters have been influenced by these very same themes. And they can mean a lot of different things. If a song moves you, that's all that's important. I don't have to know what a song means. I've written all kinds of things into my songs. And I'm not going to worry about it – what it all means. When Melville put all his old testament, biblical references, scientific theories, Protestant doctrines, and all that knowledge of the sea and sailing ships and whales into one story, I don't think he would have worried about it either – what it all means.
John Donne as well, the poet-priest who lived in the time of Shakespeare, wrote these words, ""The Sestos and Abydos of her breasts. Not of two lovers, but two loves, the nests."" I don't know what it means, either. But it sounds good. And you want your songs to sound good.
When Odysseus in The Odyssey visits the famed warrior Achilles in the underworld – Achilles, who traded a long life full of peace and contentment for a short one full of honor and glory –  tells Odysseus it was all a mistake. ""I just died, that's all."" There was no honor. No immortality. And that if he could, he would choose to go back and be a lowly slave to a tenant farmer on Earth rather than be what he is – a king in the land of the dead – that whatever his struggles of life were, they were preferable to being here in this dead place.
That's what songs are too. Our songs are alive in the land of the living. But songs are unlike literature. They're meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare's plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, ""Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story."""
Nobody ’Cept You,Nobody 'Cept You,Bob Dylan,"There’s nothing ’round here I believe in
’Cept you, yeah you
And there’s nothing to me that’s sacred
’Cept you, yeah you

You’re the one that reaches me
You’re the one that I admire
Every time we meet together
My soul feels like it’s on fire
Nothing matters to me
And there’s nothing I desire
’Cept you, yeah you

Nothing ’round here I care to try for
’Cept you, yeah you
Got nothing left to live or die for
’Cept you, yeah you

There’s a hymn I used to hear
In the churches all the time
Make me feel so good inside
So peaceful, so sublime
And there’s nothing to remind me of that
Old familiar chime
’Cept you, uh huh you
Used to play in the cemetery
Dance and sing and run when I was a child
Never seemed strange
But now I just pass mournfully by
That place where the bones of life are piled
I know something’ has changed
I’m a stranger here and no one sees me
’Cept you, yeah you

Nothing much matters or seems to please me
’Cept you, yeah you
Nothing hypnotizes me
Or holds me in a spell
Everything runs by me
Just like water from a well
Everybody wants my attention
Everybody’s got something to sell
’Cept you, yeah you"
North Country Blues,North Country Blues,Bob Dylan,"Come an' gather 'round friends
And I'll tell ya' a tale
Of when the red iron ore pits ran a-plenty
But the cardboard filled windows
And old men on the benches
Tell you now that the whole town is empty
In the north end of town
My own children are grown
Well I was raised on the other
In the wee hours of youth
My mother took sick
And I was brought up by my brother
The iron ore poured
As the years passed the door
The drag lines and the shovels they was a-hummin'
'Til one day my brother
Failed to come home
The same as my father before him
Well a long winter's wait
From the winda' I watched
My friends they couldn'ta been kinder
And my school it was cut
As I quit in the spring
To marry John Thomas, a miner
Oh the years passed again
And the givin' was good
With the lunch bucket filled every season
What with three babies born
The work was cut down
To a half a day's shift with no reason
Then the shaft was soon shut
And more work was cut
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
'Til a man come to speak
And he said in one week
That number eleven was closin'
They complained in the East
They're payin' too high
They say that your ore ain't worth a-diggin'
That it's much cheaper down
In the South American towns
Where the miners work almost for nothin'
So the minin' gates locked
And the red iron rotted
And the room smelled heavy from drinkin'
When the sad silent song
Made the hour twice as long
As I waited for the sun to go sinking
I lived by the window
As he talked to himself
This silence of tongues it was buildin'
'Til one morning's wake
The bed it was bare
And I's left alone with three children
The summer is gone
The ground's turning cold
The stores one by one they're a-foldin'
My children will go
As soon they grow
Well there ain't nothin' here now to hold them"
Not Dark Yet,Not Dark Yet,Bob Dylan,"Shadows are falling
And I’ve been here all day
It’s too hot to sleep
And time is running away
Feel like my soul has
Turned into steel
I’ve still got the scars
That the sun didn’t heal
There’s not even room enough
To be anywhere
It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there

Well, my sense of humanity
Has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing
There’s been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter
And she wrote it so kind
She put down in writing
What was in her mind
I just don’t see why I should even care
It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there

Well, I’ve been to London
And I’ve been to gay Paris
I’ve followed the river
And I got to the sea
I’ve been down on the bottom
Of a world full of lies
I ain’t looking for nothing
In anyone’s eyes
Sometimes my burden
Is more than I can bear
It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there


I was born here, and I’ll die here
Against my will
I know it looks like I’m moving
But I’m standing still
Every nerve in my body
Is so vacant and numb
I can’t even remember what it was
I came here to get away from
Don’t even hear a murmur of a prayer
It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there"

And is our purpose not the same on this earth
To love and follow His direction?

A veil of moonlight on her lonely face

And listen to it hiss
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn

And keep me company

There’s more frost on the window glass
With each new tender kiss

To you, but you have to treat me
I won't let her to
And then I try my best to hunt her, you.."
On the Road Again,On the Road Again,Bob Dylan,"Well, I wake up in the morning
There's frogs inside my socks
Your mama, she's hidin'
Inside the icebox
Your daddy walks in wearin'
A Napoleon Bonaparte mask
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, do you have to ask?
Well, I go to pet your monkey
I get a face full of claws
I ask who's in the fireplace
And you tell me Santa Claus
The milkman comes in
He's wearing a derby hat
And you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Well, I asked for somethin' to eat
I'm hungry as a hog
So I get brown rice, seaweed
And a dirty hot dog
I've got a hole
Where my stomach disappeared
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I gotta' think you're really weird
Your grandpa's cane
It turns into a sword
Your grandma prays to pictures
That are pasted on a board
Everything inside my pockets
Your uncle steals
And you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I can't believe that you're for real
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen
They're enough to make me cry
Little mailman comes in
Even he's got to take a side
Even the butler
He's got something to prove
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you don't move?"
Once Upon a Time,Once Upon a Time,Bob Dylan,"Once upon a time
A girl with moonlight in her eyes
Put her hand in mine
And said she loved me so
But that was once upon a time
Very long ago
Once upon a hill
We sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn
But that was once upon a time
Now the tree is gone
How the breeze ruffled through her hair
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there
We were young and didn't have a care
Where did it go
Once upon a time
The world was sweeter than we knew
Everything was ours
How happy we were then
But somehow once upon a time
Never comes again
Once upon a time
Never comes again"
One Man’s Loss,One Man's Loss,Bob Dylan,"One man's loss always is another man's gain
Let's take a cherry, I can't make it no more
Can't stop, she's breaking all time on the floor
Better come down easy or don't come down at all
You don't try and to please me, somebody's gonna fall
One man's loss always is another man's gain
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain
Eight o'clock in the morning, better step aside
Let me be to your warning, you better go by
Three times a loser, number 45
Better not lose her, best stayed alive
One man's loss always is another man's gain
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain
Wish I'd have found me (??) at the wall
One look at the watch, you better lord at all
You can't stop it or wait it (??) at night
Too hard to keep you waiting, calls me aside
One man's loss always is another man's gain
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain"
One More Cup of Coffee,One More Cup of Coffee,Bob Dylan,"Your breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
But I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
Your daddy he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf
And your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below"
One More Night,One More Night,Bob Dylan,"One more night, the stars are in sight
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be
Oh, the moon is shinin' bright
Lighting everything in sight
But tonight no light will shine on me

Oh, it's shameful and it's sad I lost the only pal I had
I just could not be what she wanted me to be
I will turn my head up high
To that dark and rollin' sky
For tonight no light will shine on me

I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true
I had no idea what a woman in love would do

One more night, I will wait for the light
While the wind blows high above the tree
Oh, I miss my darlin' so
I didn't mean to see her go
But tonight no light will shine on me

One more night, the moon is shinin' bright
And the wind blows high above the tree
Oh, I miss that woman so
I didn't mean to see her go
But tonight no light will shine on me"
One More Weekend,One More Weekend,Bob Dylan,"Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run
I’m looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun
One more weekend, one more weekend with you
One more weekend, one more weekend’ll do

Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck
We’ll fly over the ocean just like you suspect
One more weekend, one more weekend with you
One more weekend, one more weekend’ll do

We’ll fly the night away
Hang out the whole next day
Things will be okay
You wait and see
We’ll go someplace unknown
Leave all the children home
Honey, why not go alone
Just you and me

Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood
I’m happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good
One more weekend, one more weekend with you
One more weekend, one more weekend’ll do (yes, you will!)
Like a needle in a haystack, I’m gonna find you yet
You’re the sweetest gone mama that this boy’s ever gonna get
One more weekend, one more weekend with you
One more weekend, one more weekend’ll do"
One Too Many Mornings,One Too Many Mornings,Bob Dylan,"Down the street the dogs are barkin'
And the day is a-gettin' dark
As the night comes in a-falling
The dogs will lose their bark
And the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
Yes I’m one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind
From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes start to fade
And I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
And I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And I’m one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind
It’s a restless hungry feeling
That don’t mean no one no good
When everything I’m a-sayin'
You can say it just as good
You’re right from your side
I'm right from mine
We’re both just one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind"
One for the Road,One for the Road,Bob Dylan,"One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road
I cry alone at night
Please tell me it's only night
And she's calling me back at night
And she's already home
One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road
I cry alone at night
There is no friend in sight
I love getting back at night
But I wish I don't
One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road
This bottle is dried up too
And I'll be all cried up soon
I can't see no God on the moon
It's a long way to go
One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road
I cry alone at night
He's not alone at night
I'll be there my whole night
But I wish it was whole
One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road"
One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later),One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later),Bob Dylan,"I didn’t mean to treat you so bad
You shouldn’t take it so personal
I didn’t mean to make you so sad
You just happened to be there, that’s all
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile
I thought that it was well understood
That you’d be comin' back in a little while
I didn’t know that you were sayin’ goodbye for good

But, sooner or later, one of us must know
That you just did what you’re supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you

I couldn’t see what you could show me
Your scarf had kept your mouth well hid
I couldn’t see how you could know me
But you said you knew me and I believed you did
When you whispered in my ear
And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her
I didn’t realize just what I did hear
I didn’t realize how young you were
But, sooner or later, one of us must know
That you just did what you’re supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you

And I couldn’t see when it started snowin'
Your voice was all that I heard
I couldn’t see where we were goin'
But you said ya' knew an’ I took your word
And then ya' told me later, as I apologized
That you were just kiddin’ me, you weren’t really from the farm
An’ I told you, as ya' clawed out my eyes
That I never really meant to do you any harm

But, sooner or later, one of us must know
That you just did what you’re supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you"
Only a Hobo,Only a Hobo,Bob Dylan,"As I was out walking on a corner one day
I spied an old hobo, in a doorway he lay
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
And I guess he’d been there for the whole night or more

Only a hobo, but one more is gone
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song
Leaving nobody to carry him home
Only a hobo, but one more is gone

A blanket of newspaper covered his head
As the curb was his pillow, the street was his bed
One look at his face showed the hard road he’d come
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed


Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down
To look up on the world from a hole in the ground
To wait for your future like a horse that’s gone lame
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?"
Only a Pawn in Their Game,Only a Pawn in Their Game,Bob Dylan,"A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers’ blood
A finger fired the trigger to his name
A handle hid out in the dark
A hand set the spark
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a man’s brain
But he can’t be blamed
He’s only a pawn in their game
A South politician preaches to the poor white man
“You got more than the blacks, don’t complain
You’re better than them, you been born with white skin,” they explain
And the Negro’s name
Is used it is plain
For the politician’s gain
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid
And the marshals and cops get the same
But the poor white man’s used in the hands of them all like a tool
He’s taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him
To protect his white skin
To keep up his hate
So he never thinks straight
'Bout the shape that he’s in
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And the hoof beats pound in his brain
And he’s taught how to walk in a pack
Shoot in the back, with his fist in a clinch
To hang and to lynch
To hide 'neath the hood
To kill with no pain
Like a dog on a chain
He ain't a-got no name
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game
Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught
They lowered him down as a king
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun
He’ll see by his grave
On the stone that remains
Carved next to his name
His epitaph plain
Only a pawn in their game"
Outlaw Blues,Outlaw Blues,Bob Dylan,"Ain't it hard to stumble
And land in some funny lagoon?
Ain't it hard to stumble
And land in some muddy lagoon?
Especially when it's nine below zero
And three o'clock in the afternoon

Ain't gonna hang no picture
Ain't gonna hang no picture frame
Ain't gonna hang no picture
Or hang no picture frame
Well, I might look like Robert Ford
But I feel just like a'Jesse James

And I wish I was
On some Australian mountain range
Oh, I wish I was
On some Australian mountain range
I got no reason to be there, but I
Imagine it would be some kinda change

I got my dark sunglasses
I got for good luck my black tooth
I got my dark sunglasses
I'm carrying my good luck, my black tooth
Don't ask me nothin' about nothin'
I just might tell you the truth
I got a woman in Jackson
Oh, I ain't gonna say her name
I got a woman in Jackson
I ain't gonna say her name
She's a brown-skin woman
But I love her just the same"
Oxford Town,Oxford Town,Bob Dylan,"Oxford Town, Oxford Town
Everybody’s got their heads bowed down
The sun don’t shine above the ground
I am a-going down to Oxford Town

He went down to Oxford Town
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown
Better get away from Oxford Town

Oxford Town around the bend
Come in to the door, he couldn’t get in
All because of the color of his skin
What do you think about that, my friend?

Me, my girl, my girl’s son
We got met with a tear gas bomb
I don’t even know why we come
Going back where we come from

Oxford Town in the afternoon
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune
Two men died beneath the Mississippi moon
Somebody better investigate soon"

O’ Little Town of Bethlehem,O’ Little Town of Bethlehem,Bob Dylan,"O' little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shine
An everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of all His heaven
No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him still
The dear Christ enters in
Amen"
P.S. I Love You,P.S. I Love You,Bob Dylan,"Dear, I thought I'd drop a line
The weather's cool. The folks are fine
I'm in bed each night at nine
P.S. I love you
Yesterday we had some rain
But all in all I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train?
P.S. I love you
Write to the Browns just as soon as you're able
They came around to call
I burned a hole in the dining room table
And let me see, I guess that's all
Nothin' else for me to say
And so I'll close. Oh, by the way
Everybody's thinkin' of you
P.S. I love you
I do my best to obey all your wishes
I put a sign up. Think
Now I got to buy us a new set of dishes
Or wash the ones that have piled in the sink
Nothing else to tell you, dear
Except, each day feels like a year
Every night I'm dreamin' of you
P.S. I love you
P.S. I love you"
Paths of Victory,Paths of Victory,Bob Dylan,"Trails of troubles
Roads of battles
Paths of victory
I shall walk

The trail is dusty
And my road it might be rough
But the better roads are waiting
And boys it ain’t far off


I walked down by the river
I turned my head up high
I saw that silver linin’
That was hanging in the sky


The evening dusk was rolling
I was walking down the track
There was a one-way wind a-blowin’
And it was blowin’ at my back

The gravel road is bumpy
It’s a hard road to ride
But there’s a clearer road a-waitin’
With the cinders on the side


That evening train was rolling
The humming of its wheels
My eyes they saw a better day
As I looked across the fields


The trail is dusty
The road it might be rough
But the good road is a-waiting
And boys it ain’t far off"
Pay in Blood,Pay in Blood,Bob Dylan,"Well I'm grinding my life out, steady and sure
Nothing more wretched than what I must endure
I'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun
I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done
Sooner or later you make a mistake
I'll put you in a chain that you never will break
Legs and arms and body and bone
I pay in blood, but not my own

Night after night, day after day
They strip your useless hopes away
The more I take the more I give
The more I die the more I live
I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim
I got dogs could tear you limb from limb
I'm circling around the Southern Zone
I pay in blood, but not my own

Low cards are what I've got
But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not
I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God
You could put me out in front of a firing squad
I've been out and around with the rowdy men
Just like you, my handsome friend
My head's so hard, must be made of stone
I pay in blood, but not my own
Another politician pumping out the piss
Another angry beggar blowing you a kiss
You got the same eyes that your mother does
If only you could prove who your father was
Someone must have slipped a drug in your wine
You gulped it down and you cross the line
Man can't live by bread alone
I pay in blood, but not my own

How I made it back home, nobody knows
Or how I survived so many blows
I've been through hell, what good did it do?
You bastard! I'm suppose to respect you?
I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse
Show me your moral virtues first
Hear me holler and hear me moan
I pay in blood but not my own
You pet your lover in the bed
Come here, I'll break your lousy head
Our nation must be saved and freed
You've been accused of murder, how do you plead?
This is how I spend my days
I came to bury, not to praise
I'll drink my fill and sleep alone
I pay in blood, but not my own"
Peggy Day,Peggy Day,Bob Dylan,"Peggy Day stole my poor heart away
By golly, what more can I say?
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day

Peggy Night makes my future look so bright
Man, that girl is out of sight
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night

Well, ya' know that even before I learned her name
Ya' know I loved her just the same
And I tell ’em all, wherever I may go
Just so they’ll know, that she my little lady
And I love her so

Peggy Day stole my poor heart away
Turned my skies to blue from gray
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day


Peggy Day stole my poor heart away
By golly, what more can I say?
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day"
People Get Ready,People Get Ready,Bob Dylan,"People get ready, there's a train a-comin'
Don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the lord
People get ready for the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers, coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em
There's room for all among those loved the most
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
Oh, there's no hidin' place against the kingdom's throne
So people get ready, there's a train a-comin'
Don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith, open the doors and board 'em
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the lord"

Political World,Political World,Bob Dylan,"We live in a political world
Love don’t have any place
We’re living in times where men commit crimes
And crime don’t have a face

We live in a political world
Icicles hanging down
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Clouds cover up the ground

We live in a political world
Wisdom is thrown into jail
It rots in a cell, is misguided as hell
Leaving no one to pick up a trail

We live in a political world
Where mercy walks the plank
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Up the steps into the nearest bank

We live in a political world
Where courage is a thing of the past
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted
The next day could be your last
We live in a political world
The one we can see and can feel
But there’s no one to check, it’s all a stacked deck
We all know for sure that it’s real

We live in a political world
In the cities of lonesome fear
Little by little you turn in the middle
But you’re never sure why you’re here

We live in a political world
Under the microscope
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there
You always got more than enough rope

We live in a political world
Turning and a-thrashing about
As soon as you’re awake, you’re trained to take
What looks like the easy way out

We live in a political world
Where peace is not welcome at all
It’s turned away from the door to wander some more
Or put up against the wall
We live in a political world
Everything is hers or his
Climb into the frame and shout God’s name
But you’re never sure what it is"
Polka Dots and Moonbeams,Polka Dots and Moonbeams,Bob Dylan,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an, ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream
The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said, ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream
There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more
Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words, ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream"

The side that’s winning

You say I let you down
You know it’s not like that
If you’re so hurt
Why then don’t you show it?

You say you lost your faith
But that’s not where it’s at
You had no faith to lose

If I was a master thief
Perhaps I’d rob them

And now I know you’re dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don’t you understand
It’s not my problem
I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you

Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You’d know what a drag it is
To see you"
Positively Van Gogh,Positively Van Gogh,Bob Dylan,"When I'd ask why the painting was deadly
Nobody could pick up my sign
'Cept for the cook, she was always friendly
But she'd only ask, ""What's on your mind?""
She'd say that especially when it was raining
I'd say ""Oh, I don't know""
But then she'd press and I'd say, ""You see that painting?
Do you think it's been done by Van Gogh?""

The cook she said call her Maria
She'd always point for the same boy to come forth
Saying, ""He trades cattle, it's his own idea
And he also makes trips to the North
Have you ever seen his naked calf bleed?""
I'd say, ""Oh no, why does it show?""
And she'd whisper in my ear that he's a half-breed
And I'd say, ""Fine, but can he paint like Van Gogh?""

I can't remember his name he never gave it
But I always figured he could go home
Til when he'd gave me his card and said, ""Save it""
I could see by his eyes he was alone
But it was sad how his four leaf clover
Drawn on his calling card showed
That it was given back to him a-many times over
And it most definitely was not done by Van Gogh
It was either she or the maid just to please me
Though I sensed she could not understand
And she made a thing out of it by saying, ""Go easy
He's a straight, but he's a very crooked straight man.""
And I'd say, ""Does the girl in the calendar doubt it?
And by the way is it Marilyn Monroe?""
But she'd just speak softly and say, ""Why you wanna know about it?""
And I'd say, ""I was just wondering if she ever sat for Van Gogh.""

It was either her or the straight man who introduced me
To Jeanette, Camilla's friend
Who later on falsely accused me of stealing her locket and pen
When I said ""I don't have the locket""
She said ""You steal pictures of everybody's mother I know""
And I said ""There's no locket
No picture of any mother I would pocket
Unless it's been done by Van Gogh.""

Camilla's house stood on the outskirts
How strange to see the chandeliers destroyed
While  beneath the velvet carpet
Of fox hunts and love far before"
Po’ Boy,Po' Boy,Bob Dylan,"Man comes to the door—I say, “For whom are you looking?”
He says, “Your wife,” I say, “She’s busy in the kitchen cooking”
Poor boy—where you been?
I already told you—won’t tell you again

I say, “How much you want for that?” I go into the store
The man says, “Three dollars.” “All right,” I say, “Will you take four?”
Poor boy—never say die
Things will be all right by and by

Been working on the mainline—working like the devil
The game is the same—it’s just on a different level
Poor boy—dressed in black
Police at your back

Poor boy in a red hot town
Out beyond the twinkling stars
Riding first-class trains—making the rounds
Trying to keep from falling between the cars

Othello told Desdemona, “I’m cold, cover me with a blanket
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?”
She says, “I gave it to you, you drank it”
Poor boy, laying them straight—picking up the cherries falling off the plate
Time and love has branded me with its claws
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws
Poor boy, in the hotel called the Palace of Gloom
Calls down to room service, says send up a room

My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him
When my mother died, my uncle took me in—he ran a funeral parlor
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won’t forget him

All I know is that I’m thrilled by your kiss
I don’t know any more than this
Poor boy, picking up sticks
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks

Knocking on the door, I say, “Who is it and where are you from?”
Man says, “Freddy!” I say, “Freddy who?” He says, “Freddy or not here I come”
Poor boy beneath the stars that shine
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine"
Precious Angel,Precious Angel,Bob Dylan,"Precious angel
Under the sun
How was I to know
You'd be the one
To show me I was blinded
To show me I was gone
How weak was the foundation
I was standing upon?
Now there's spiritual warfare
And flesh and blood breaking down
You either got faith or you got unbelief
And there is no neutral ground
The enemy is subtle
How be it we are so deceived
When the truth's in our hearts
And we still don't believe?

Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
You know I just couldn't make it by myself
I'm a little too blind to see
My so-called friends
Have fallen under a spell
They look me squarely in the eye
And they say, ""All is well""
Can they imagine the darkness
That will fall from on high
When men will beg God to kill them
And they won't be able to die?
Sister, let me tell you
About a vision that I saw
You were drawing water for your husband
You were suffering under the law
You were telling him about Buddha
You were telling him about Mohammed, in one breath
You never mentioned one time
The Man who came and died a criminal's death

Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
You know I just couldn't make it by myself
I'm a little too blind to see
Precious angel
You believe me when I say
What God has given to us
No man can take away
We are covered in blood, girl
You know both our forefathers were slaves
Let us hope they've found mercy
In their bone-filled graves
You're the queen of my flesh, girl
You're my woman, you're my delight
You're the lamp of my soul, girl
And you torch up the night
But there's violence in the eyes, girl
So let us not be enticed
On the way out of Egypt
Through Ethiopia
To the judgment hall of Christ

Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
You know I just couldn't make it by myself
I'm a little too blind to see
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)

Precious Memories,Precious Memories,Bob Dylan,"As I travel down life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder
Precious memories flood my soul

Glide across the lonely years
And old homes scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appears

Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold"
Pressing On,Pressing On,Bob Dylan,"Well I’m pressing on
Yes, I’m pressing on
Well I’m pressing on
To the higher calling of my Lord

Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind
Say, “Prove to me that He is Lord, show me a sign”
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within
When what’s lost has been found, what’s to come has already been?


Shake the dust off of your feet, don’t look back
Nothing now can hold you down, nothing that you lack
Temptation’s not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Because he sinned I got no choice, it run in my vein"
Pretty Boy Floyd,Pretty Boy Floyd,Bob Dylan,"If you'll gather 'round me, people
A story, I will tell
About Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well
It was in the town of Shawnee
On a Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in a wagon
As into town they rode
There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
An' his wife, she overheard
Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed his gun
And in the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down
Now, he took to the hills and timber
To live the life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name
He took to the trees and timber
On the Canadian river shore
And Pretty Boy found a welcome
At every farmer's door
Others tell you of a stranger
That come to beg a meal
And underneath the napkin
Left a thousand-dollar bill
'Twas in Oklahoma City
It was on a Christmas Day
There come a whole car load of groceries
And a letter that did say:
You say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
Well, here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief
Well, it's through this world I've rambled
I've seen lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a six-gun
And some with a fountain pen
Well, it's through this world you ramble
It's through this world you roam
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home"
Pretty Peggy-O,Pretty Peggy-O,Bob Dylan,"I've been around this whole country
But I never yet found Fenneario

Well, as we marched down, as we marched down
Well, as we marched down to Fennerio
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O

Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O
What will your mother say to know you're going away
You're never, never, never coming back-io ?

Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O
Come a-running down your stairs
Combing back your yellow hair
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-io

He's a-riding down in Texas with the rodeo

He's buried somewhere in Louisiana-O"

Oh Willie, oh Willie, I'm scared of your ways
I'm scared you will lead my poor body astray
Pretty Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed just about right
Well, Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed just about right
For I dug on your grave the best part of last night
She through her arms around him and she began to cry
She through her arms around him and she began to cry
I can't kill a woman that loves you such as I
There's no time to talk now, there's no time to stand
There's no time to talk now, there's no time to stand
He drew out his dagger all in his right hand
He pierced her in the heart and her lifeblood did run
He pierced her in the heart the lifeblood did flow
Deep in her grave Pretty Polly did go
He threw the dirt around her and then he went home
He threw the dirt around her and then he went home
With nobody there but the wild birds to moan
A debt to the devil Willie must pay
A debt to the devil Willie must pay
For killing Pretty Polly and running away

Oh, where is Pretty Polly? Yonder she stands
The rings on the fingers of her lilywhite hand

Pretty Saro,Pretty Saro,Bob Dylan,"Down in some lone valley
In a sad lonesome place
Where the wild birds do all
Their notes to increase
Farewell pretty Saro
I bid you Adieu
But I dream of pretty Saro
Wherever I go
Well my love she won't have me
So I understand
She wants a freeholder
Who owns a house and land
I cannot maintain her
With silver and gold
And all of the fine things
That a big house can hold
If I was a poet
And could write a fine hand
I'd write my love a letter
That she'd understand
And write it by the river
Where the waters overflow
But I dream of pretty Saro
Wherever I go"
Property of Jesus,Property of Jesus,Bob Dylan,"Go ahead and talk about him because he makes you doubt
Because he has denied himself the things that you can’t live without
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through

He’s the property of Jesus
Resent him to the bone
You got something better
You’ve got a heart of stone

Stop your conversation when he passes on the street
Hope he falls upon himself, oh, won’t that be sweet
Because he can’t be exploited by superstition anymore
Because he can’t be bribed or bought by the things that you adore


When the whip that’s keeping you in line doesn’t make him jump
Say he’s hard-of-hearing, say that he’s a chump
Say he’s out of step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Because he doesn’t pay no tribute to the king that you serve

Say that he’s a loser ’cause he got no common sense
Because he don’t increase his worth at someone else’s expense
Because he’s not afraid of trying, ’cause he don’t look at you and smile
’Cause he doesn’t tell you jokes or fairy tales, say he’s got no style


You can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games
You think that when you rest at last you’ll go back from where you came
But you’ve picked up quite a story and you’ve changed since the womb
What happened to the real you, you’ve been captured but by whom?"

Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you
And the smell of their roses does not remain
And all of your children start to resent you
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Have died in battle or in vain
And you’re sick of all this repetition
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
At your feet to convince you of your pain
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Now when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And you want somebody ya' don’t have to speak to

Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild

"Rambler, Gambler","Rambler, Gambler",Bob Dylan,"I’m a rambler, I’m a gambler
I’m a long way from my home
If the people don’t like me
They can leave me alone

Come sit down beside me
Come sit down right here
Come sit down, love, I want you
Love you boldly, so dear

When you get to Wyoming
A letter you’ll see
If you get into trouble
Just you write and tell me

For I once had a lover
Her age was sixteen
She’s a flower of velvet and the rose of Celine

Her parents was against me
Now she is the same
If I write on your book, love
Just you blot out my name
Oh there’s changes in the ocean
There’s changes in the sea
There’s changes in my true love
There's no change in me"
Rambling Gambling Willie,Rambling Gambling Willie,Bob Dylan,"Come around you roving’ gamblers and a story I will tell
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well
His name was Will O’Conley and he gambled all his life
He had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

Sailing’ down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans
They’re still talking’ about their card game on that Jackson River Queen
“I’ve come to win some money,” Gambling Willie says
When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true
He supported all his children and all their mothers too
He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore
He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn’t even have a pair
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows
It was late one evening’ during a poker game
A man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate
When Willie’s cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

So all you roving’ gamblers, wherever you might be
The moral of the story is very plain to see
Make your money while you can, before you have to stop
For when you pull that dead man’s hand, your gambling days are up
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows"

Where in youth's early days I was happy and free
I looked for my friends but I never could find them
I found they were all rank strangers to me

Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
No mother or dad not a friend could I see
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
I found they were all rank strangers to me

They all moved away, said a voice of a stranger
""To that beautiful home by the bright crystal sea""
Some beautiful day I'll meet them in heaven
Where no one will be a stranger to me"

Red River Shore,Red River Shore,Bob Dylan,"Some of us turn off the lights and we live
With the moonlight shooting by
Some of us scare ourselves to death in the dark
To be where the angels fly
Pretty maids all in a row lined up
Outside my cabin door
I've never wanted any of them wanting me
Except the girl from the Red River Shore

Well, I sat by her side and for a while I tried
To make that girl my wife
She gave me her best advice and she said
Go home and lead a quiet life
Well, I been to the east and I been to the west
And I been out where the black winds roar
Somehow though I never did get that far
With the girl from the Red River Shore

Well, I knew when I first laid eyes on her
I could never be free
One look at her and I knew right away
She should always be with me
Well, the dream dried up a long time ago
Don't know where it is anymore
True to life, true to me
Was the girl from the Red River Shore
Well, I'm wearing the cloak of misery
And I've tasted jilted love
And the frozen smile upon my face
Fits me like a glove
Well, I can't escape from those memories
Of the one that I'll always adore
All those nights, when I lay in the arms
Of the girl from the Red River Shore

Well, we're living in the shadows of a fading past
Trapped in the fires of time
I'd tried not to ever hurt anybody
And to stay out of a life of crime
And when it's all been said and done
I never did know the score
One more day is another day away
From the girl from the Red River Shore

Well, I'm a stranger here in a strange land
But I know this is where I belong
I'll ramble and gamble for the one I love
And the hills will give me a song
Though nothing looks familiar to me
I know I've stayed here before
Once, a thousand nights ago
With the girl from the Red River Shore
Well, I went back to see about her once
Went back to straighten it out
Everybody that I talked to had seen us there
Said they didn't know who I was talking about
Well, the sun went down on me a long time ago
I had to go back from the door
I wish I could have spent every hour of my life
With the girl from the Red River Shore

Now I heard of a guy who lived a long time ago
A man full of sorrow and strife
That if someone around him died and was dead
He knew how to bring 'em on back to life
Well, I don't know what kind of language he used
Or if they do that kind of thing anymore
Sometimes I think nobody saw me here at all
Except the girl from the Red River Shore"
Restless Farewell,Restless Farewell,Bob Dylan,"Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend
Be it mine right or wrongfully
I let it slip gladly to my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully
But the bottles are done
We’ve killed each one
And the table’s full and overflowed
And the corner sign
Says it’s closin' time
So I’ll bid farewell and be down the road
Oh every girl that ever I’ve touched
I did not do it harmfully
And every girl that ever I’ve hurt
I did not do it knowingly
But to remain as friends
You need the time to make amends
And stay behind
And since my feet are now fast
And point away from the past
I’ll bid farewell and be down the line
Oh every foe that ever I faced
The cause was there before we came
And every cause that ever I fought
I fought it full without regret or shame
But the dark does die
As the curtain is drawn and somebody’s eyes
Must meet the dawn
And if I see the day
I’d only have to stay
So I’ll bid farewell in the night and be gone
Oh, every thought that’s strung a knot in my mind
I might go insane if it couldn’t be sprung
But it’s not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes
It’s for myself and my friends my stories are sung
But the time ain’t tall, if on time you depend
And no word is possessed by no special friend
And though the line is cut
It ain’t quite the end
I’ll just bid farewell 'til we meet again
Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
To disgrace, distract, and bother me
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And the dust of rumors covers me
But if the arrow is straight
And the point is slick
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
So I’ll make my stand
And remain as I am
And bid farewell and not give a damn"
Return To Me,Return To Me,Bob Dylan,"Return to me
Oh my dear I'm so lonely
Hurry back hurry back
Oh my love hurry back I'm yours
Return to me
For my heart wants you only
Hurry home hurry home
Won't you please hurry home to my heart
My darling if I hurt you I'm sorry
Forgive me and please say you are mine
Return to me
Please come back bella mia
Hurry back hurry home to my arms
To my lips and my heart
Retorna me
Cara mia ti amo
Solo tu, solo tu, solo tu, solo tu
Mio cuore"
Ring Them Bells,Ring Them Bells,Bob Dylan,"Ring them bells, ye heathen
From the city that dreams
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries
’Cross the valleys and streams
For they’re deep and they’re wide
And the world’s on its side
And time is running backwards
And so is the bride

Ring them bells St. Peter
Where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand
So the people will know
Oh it’s rush hour now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down
Upon the sacred cow

Ring them bells Sweet Martha
For the poor man’s son
Ring them bells so the world will know
That God is one
Oh the shepherd is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled
With lost sheep

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells for all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through
Ring them bells, for the time that flies
For the child that cries
When innocence dies

Ring them bells St. Catherine
From the top of the room
Ring them from the fortress
For the lilies that bloom
Oh the lines are long
And the fighting is strong
And they’re breaking down the distance
Between right and wrong"
Ring of Fire,Ring of Fire (Ft. Johnny Cash),Bob Dylan,"Love is a burning thing
Can change into a firy ring
Bound for wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire
They say that love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh but the fire went wild
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames they went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire"
Rise Again,Rise Again,Bob Dylan,"Go ahead, drive the nails through my hand
Laugh at me where you stand
Go ahead, say it isn't me
But the day will come
That you will see

'Cause I'll rise again
Ain't no power on Earth can tie me down
Yes, I'll rise again
Death can't keep me buried in the ground

Go ahead and mock my name
You will see, I'm still the same
Go ahead, try to bury me
Very, very soon
I will be free

'Cause I'll rise again
Ain't no power on Earth can tie me now
And I'll rise again
Death can't keep me buried in the ground
Go ahead, say I'm dead and gone
You will see that you were wrong
Go ahead, try to hide the Son
But the day will come
When you'll see I'm the one

'Cause I'll rise again
Ain't no power on Earth can tie me down
Yes, I'll rise again
Death can't keep me buried in the ground"

Rocks and Gravel,Rocks and Gravel,Bob Dylan,"Takes rocks and gravel, baby, make a solid road
Make a solid road
Takes rocks and gravel, baby, make a solid road
Make a solid road
Takes a good woman mama
To satisfy my weary soul
Have you ever been down on that Mobil and K. C. line
Have you ever been down on that Mobil and K. C. line?
Well I just want to ask you
If you seen that gal of mine
Don't the clouds look lonesome shining across the sea

Don't my gal look good

Roll On John,Roll On John,Bob Dylan,"Doctor, doctor tell me the time of day
Another bottle's empty, another penny spent
He turned around and he slowly walked away
They shot him in the back and down he went

Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

From the Liverpool docks to the red-light Hamburg streets
Down in the quarry with the quarrymen
Playing to the big crowds, playing to the cheap seats
Another day in the life on your way to your journey's end


Sailin' through the trade winds bound for the South
Rags on your back just like any other slave
They tied your hands and they clamped your mouth
Wasn't no way out of that deep dark cave

I heard the news today, oh boy
They hauled your ship up on the shore
Now the city gone dark, there is no more joy
They tore the heart right out and cut him to the core


Put on your bags and get 'em packed
Leave right now, you won't be far from wrong
The sooner you go the quicker you'll be back
You've been cooped up on an island far too long


Slow down you're moving way too fast
Come together right now over me
Your bones are weary, you're about to breathe your last
Lord, you know how hard that it can be

Roll on, John, roll through the rain and snow
Take the right-hand road and go where the buffalo roam
They'll trap you in an ambush before you know
Too late now to sail back home


Tyger, tyger burning bright
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
In the forests of the night
Cover 'em over and let him sleep"
Rollin’ and Tumblin’,Rollin' and Tumblin',Bob Dylan,"I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long
I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long
Woke up this morning', I must have bet my money wrong

I got troubles so hard, I can't stand the strain
I got troubles so hard, I just can't stand the strain
Some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains

The landscape is glowing', gleaming' in the golden light of day
The landscape is glowing', gleaming' in the gold light of day
I am not holding nothing' back now, I am not standing' in anybody's way

Well, I did all I know just to keep you off my mind
Well, I did all I know just to keep you off my mind
Well, I paid and I paid and my suffering' heart is always on the line

Well, I get up in the dawn and I go down and lay in the shade
I get up in the dawn and I go down and lay in the shade
I ain't nobody's house boy, I ain't nobody's well trained maid

I'm flat-out spent, this woman has been driving' me to tears
I'm flat-out spent, this woman she has been driving' me to tears
This woman so crazy, I swear I ain't gonna touch another one for years
Well, the warm weather is coming' and the buds are on the vine
The warm weather's comin', the buds are on the vine
Ain't nothing so depressing as trying to satisfy this woman of mine

I got up this morning', saw the rising sun return
Well, I got up this morning', seen the rising sun return
Sooner or later you too shall burn

The night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom
The night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom
I've been conjuring up all these long dead souls from their crumbling' tombs

Let's forgive each other darling', let's go down to the greenwood glen
Let's forgive each other darling', let's go down to the greenwood glen
Let's put our heads together, let's put old matters to an end

Now I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long
Ah, I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long
I woke up this morning, I think I must be traveling' wrong"
Romance in Durango,Romance in Durango,Bob Dylan,"Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun
Dust on my face and my cape
Me and Magdalena on the run
I think this time we shall escape
Sold my guitar to the baker’s son
For a few crumbs and a place to hide
But I can get another one
And I’ll play for Magdalena as we ride

No Ilores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango

Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people
Hoof beats like castanets on stone
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon
Was it me that shot him down in the Cantina
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena
The dogs are barking and what’s done is done

In the corrida we’ll sit in the shade
And watch the young torero stand alone
We’ll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
When they rode with Villa into Torreón
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
In the little church this side of town
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold
You’ll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown
The way is long but the end is near
Already the fiesta has begun
The face of God will appear
With His serpent eyes of obsidian


Was that the thunder that I heard?
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain
Come sit by me, don’t say a word
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun
Look up in the hills, that flash of light
Aim well my little one
We may not make it through the night"
Roving Gambler,Roving Gambler,Bob Dylan,"I am a rovin' gambler, I've gambled all around
Wherever I meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
(I Lay my money down, lay my money down.)
I gambled up in Washington, gambled over in Spain
I'm on my way to Frisco town
To knock down my last game
(knock down my last game; knock down my last game)
I had not been in 'Frisco, many more days than three
I fell in love with a pretty little girl
And she fell in love with me
(Fell in love with me, fell in love with me.)
She took me in her parlor, she cooled me with a fan
She whispered low in her mama's ear
""I love this gamblin' man.""
(""Love this gamelin' man."" ""Love this gamblin' man."")
""Daughter, Oh! dear daughter, how could you treat me so?
And leave your dear old mother
And with a gambler go?""
(With a gambler go? with a gambler go?)
""Mother, Oh dear mother, I'll tell you if I can
If you ever see my face again
I'll be with the gamblin' man""
(be with the gamblin' man"" be with the gamblin' man)"
Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands,Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands,Bob Dylan,"With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
With your pockets well protected at last
And your streetcar visions which ya' place on the grass
And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass
Who could they get to carry you?

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I put them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
And your basement clothes and your hollow face
Who among them can think he could outguess you?
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Into your eyes where the moonlight swims
And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns
Who among them would try to impress you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I put them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss
And ya' wouldn’t know it woulda' happened like this
But a'who among them really wants just to kiss you?
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And your Spanish manners and your mother’s drugs
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs
Who among them do ya' think could resist you?

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
How could they ever mistake you?
They wished you’d accepted the blame for the farm
But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms
How could they ever have persuaded you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go
And your gentleness now, which you just can’t help but show
Who among them do you think would employ you?
Now you stand with your thief, you’re on his parole
With your holy medallion an' your fingertips now that fold
And your saintlike face and your ghost-like soul
Who among them could ever think it could destroy you?

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?"

See her in that very tight skirt
Got what it takes
Just to make you hurt
Don't be deceived by those big bright eyes
Prefer to treat her nasty and low down lies

Makes no difference where she's been
I'm go in south and doing them things again
Bake in a hot tub, down the line
I'd rather see you ruin this a-heart of mine

I'll go see them come down my way

My woman needs it everyday
She promised this a-lad she’d stay
She’s rolling up a lotta bread to toss away

She’s in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
Now she’s opened up an old maid’s home
She’s proud, but she needs to roam
She’s gonna write herself a roadside poem about Santa Fe

Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
Since I’m never gonna cease to roam
I’m never, ever far from home
But I’ll build a geodesic dome and sail away

Don’t feel bad, no, no, no, no, don’t feel bad
It’s the best food I’ve ever had
Makes me feel so glad
That she’s cooking in a homemade pad
She never caught a cold so bad when I’m away

Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
My shrimp boat’s in the bay
I won’t have my nature this way
And I’m leaning on the wheel each day to drift away from
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
My sister looks good at home
She’s licking on an ice cream cone
She’s packin’ her big white comb
What does it weigh?"
Sara,Sara,Bob Dylan,"I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky
When the children were babies and played on the beach
You came up behind me, I saw you go by
You were always so close and still within reach

Sara, Sara
Whatever made you want to change your mind?
Sara, Sara
So easy to look at, so hard to define

I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand
They run to the water their buckets to fill
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
As they follow each other back up the hill

Sara, Sara
Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life
Sara, Sara
Radiant jewel, mystical wife
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White
You in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar
Sara, oh Sara
It’s all so clear, I could never forget
Sara, oh Sara
Loving you is the one thing I’ll never regret

I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells
I’d taken the cure and had just gotten through
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel
Writing “Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” for you

Sara, Sara
Wherever we travel we’re never apart
Sara, oh Sara
Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart

How did I meet you? I don’t know
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm

Sara, oh Sara
Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress
Sara, oh Sara
You must forgive me my unworthiness
Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore
You always responded when I needed your help
You give me a map and a key to your door

Sara, oh Sara
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow
Sara, oh Sara
Don’t ever leave me, don’t ever go"
Saved,Saved,Bob Dylan,"I was blinded by the devil
Born already ruined
Stone-cold dead
As I stepped out of the womb
By His grace I have been touched
By His word I have been healed
By His hand I’ve been delivered
By His spirit I’ve been sealed

I’ve been saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
Saved
And I’m so glad
Yes, I’m so glad
I’m so glad
So glad
I want to thank You, Lord
I just want to thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord

By His truth I can be upright
By His strength I do endure
By His power I’ve been lifted
In His love I am secure
He bought me with a price
Freed me from the pit
Full of emptiness and wrath
And the fire that burns in it

Nobody to rescue me
Nobody would dare
I was going down for the last time
But by His mercy I’ve been spared
Not by works
But by faith in Him who called
For so long I’ve been hindered
For so long I’ve been stalled"
Saving Grace,Saving Grace,Bob Dylan,"If you find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Guess I owe You some kind of apology
I’ve escaped death so many times, I know I’m only living
By the saving grace that’s over me

By this time I’d-a thought I would be sleeping
In a pine box for all eternity
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
For the saving grace that’s over me

Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection
Wherever I am welcome is where I’ll be
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Is the saving grace that’s over me

Well, the devil’s shining light, it can be most blinding
But to search for love, that ain’t no more than vanity
As I look around this world all that I’m finding
Is the saving grace that’s over me

The wicked know no peace and you just can’t fake it
There’s only one road and it leads to Calvary
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I’ll make it
By the saving grace that’s over me"
Scarlet Town,Scarlet Town,Bob Dylan,"In Scarlet Town, where I was born
There’s ivy leaf and silver thorn
The streets have names that you can’t pronounce
Gold is down to a quarter of an ounce
The music starts and the people sway
Everybody says, “Are you going my way?""
Uncle Tom still working' for Uncle Bill
Scarlet Town is under the hill

Scarlet Town in the month of May
Sweet William Holme on his deathbed lay
Mistress Mary by the side of the bed
Kissing' his face and putting' prayers on his head
So brave and true, so gentle is he
I’ll weep for him as he would weep for me
Little Boy Blue come blow your horn
In Scarlet Town, where I was born

Scarlet Town, in the hot noon hours
There’s palm-leaf shadows and scattered flowers
Beggars crouching at the gate
Help comes, but it comes too late
By marble slabs and in fields of stone
You make your humble wishes known
I touched the garment, but the hem was torn
In Scarlet Town, where I was born
In Scarlet Town, the end is near
The Seven Wonders of the World are here
The evil and the good living' side by side
All human forms seem glorified
Put your heart on a platter and see who will bite
See who will hold you and kiss you good night
There’s walnut groves and maplewood
In Scarlet Town crying' won’t do no good

In Scarlet Town, you fight your father’s foes
Up on the hill, a chilly wind blows
You fight ‘em on high and you fight 'em down in
You fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin
You’ve got legs that can drive men mad
A lot of things we didn’t do that I wish we had
In Scarlet Town, the sky is clear
You’ll wish to God that you stayed right here

Set ‘em Joe, play “Walking the Floor""
Play it for my flat-chested junkie whore
I’m staying up late, I’m making amends
While we smile, all heaven descends
If love is a sin, then beauty is a crime
All things are beautiful in their time
The black and the white, the yellow and the brown
It’s all right there in front of you in Scarlet Town"

There's just one kind of favor I'll ask for you
You can see that my grave is kept clean

And there's two white horses following me
And there's two white horses following me
I got two white horses following me
Waiting on my burying ground

Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Means another poor boy is under the ground

Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Means another poor boy is dead and gone

And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And I believe what the Bible told
And there's one last favor I'll ask for you
And there's one last favor I'll ask for you
And just one last flavor I'll ask for you
You can see that my grave is kept clean"
Seeing the Real You at Last,Seeing the Real You at Last,Bob Dylan,"Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down
But it looks like it don’t
I’d like to get you to change your mind
But it looks like you won’t

From now on I’ll be busy
I am not going to nowhere fast
I’m just glad it’s over
And I’m seeing the real you at last

Well, didn’t I risk my neck for you
Didn’t I take chances?
Didn’t I rise above it all for you
The most unfortunate circumstances?

Well, I have had some rotten nights
Didn’t think that they would pass
I’m just thankful and grateful
To be seeing the real you at last

I’m hungry and I’m irritable
And I’m tired of this bag of tricks
At one time there was nothing wrong with me
That you could not fix
Well, I sailed through the storm
Strapped to the mast
But the time has come
And I’m seeing the real you at last

When I met you, baby
You didn’t show no visible scars
You could ride like Annie Oakley
You could shoot like Belle Starr

Well, I don’t mind a reasonable amount of trouble
Trouble always comes to pass
But all I care about now
Is that I’m seeing the real you at last

Well, I’m going to quit this baby talk now
I guess I should have known
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles
I think maybe we’d better leave each other alone

Whatever you going to do
Please do it fast
I’m still trying to get used to
Seeing the real you at last"

How long are we gonna be ridin'?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Will there be any comfort there, senor?
There's a wicked wind still blowin' on that upper deck
There's an iron cross still hanging down from around her neck
There's a marchin' band still playin' in that vacant lot
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, ""Forget me not""
Senor, senor, I can see that painted wagon
I can smell the tail of the dragon
Can't stand the suspense anymore
Can you tell me who to contact here, senor?
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Was that train load of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring
Said,""Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing""
Senor, senor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor
I'm ready when you are, senor
Senor, senor, let's disconnect these cables
Overturn these tables
This place don't make sense to me no more
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, senor?"
Sentimental Journey,Sentimental Journey,Bob Dylan,"Gonna take a sentimental journey
Gonna set my heart at ease
Gonna make a sentimental journey
To renew old memories
I got my bag, I got my reservation
Spent each dime I could afford
Like a child in wild anticipation
I long to hear that: ""All aboard!""
Seven, that's the time we leave - at seven
I'll be waiting up for heaven
Counting every mile of railroad track - that moves me back
I never though my heart could be so yearny
Why did I decide to roam
Gotta take a sentimental journey
Sentimental journey home"
September of My Years,September of My Years,Bob Dylan,"One day you turn around and it's summer
Next day you turn around and it's fall
And the springs and the winters of a lifetime
Whatever happened to them all?
As a man who has always had the wand'ring ways
Now I'm reaching back for yesterdays
'Til a long-forgotten love appears
And I find that I'm sighing softly as I near
September, the warm September of my years
As I man who has never paused at wishing wells
Now I'm watching children's carousels
And their laughter's music to my ears
And I find that I'm smiling gently as I near
September, the warm September of my years
The golden warm September of my years"
Series of Dreams,Series of Dreams,Bob Dylan,"I was thinking of a series of dreams
Where nothing comes up to the top
Everything stays down where it’s wounded
And comes to a permanent stop
Wasn’t thinking of anything specific
Like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams
Nothing too very scientific
Just thinking of a series of dreams

Thinking of a series of dreams
Where the time and the tempo fly
And there’s no exit in any direction
’Cept the one that you can’t see with your eyes
Wasn’t making any great connection
Wasn’t falling for any intricate scheme
Nothing that would pass inspection
Just thinking of a series of dreams

Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Into the path you are hurled
And the cards are no good that you’re holding
Unless they’re from another world
In one, numbers were burning
In another, I witnessed a crime
In one, I was running, and in another
All I seemed to be doing was climb
Wasn’t looking for any special assistance
Not going to any great extremes
I’d already gone the distance
Just thinking of a series of dreams"
Seven Curses,Seven Curses,Bob Dylan,"Old Reilly stole a stallion
But they caught him and they brought him back
And they laid him down on the Jailhouse ground
With an iron chain around his neck

Old Reilly’s daughter got a message
That her father was going’ to hang
She rode by night and came by morning
With gold and silver in her hand

When the judge he saw Reilly’s daughter
His old eyes deepened in his head
Saying, “Gold will never free your father
The price, my dear, is you instead”

“Oh I’m as good as dead,” cried Reilly
“It’s only you that he does crave
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all
Get on your horse and ride away”

“Oh father you will surely die
If I don’t take the chance to try
And pay the price and not take your advice
For that reason I will have to stay”
The gallows shadows shook the evening
In the night a hound dog bayed
In the night the grounds were groaning
In the night the price was paid

The next morning she had awoken
To know that the judge had never spoken
She saw that hangin’ branch a-bendin’
She saw her father’s body broken

These be seven curses on a judge so cruel:
That one doctor will not save him
That two healers will not heal him
That three eyes will not see him

That four ears will not hear him
That five walls will not hide him
That six diggers will not bury him
And that seven deaths shall never kill him"
Seven Days,Seven Days,Bob Dylan,"Seven days, seven more days she’ll be coming
I’ll be waiting at the station for her to arrive
Seven more days, all I gotta do is survive

She been gone ever since I been a child
Ever since I seen her smile, I ain’t forgotten her eyes
She had a face that could outshine the sun in the skies
I been good, I been good while I been waiting
Maybe guilty of hesitating, I just been holding on
Seven more days, all that’ll be gone

There’s kissing in the valley
Thieving in the alley
Fighting every inch of the way
Trying to be tender
With somebody I remember
In a night that’s always brighter’n the day

Seven days, seven more days that are connected
Just like I expected, she’ll be coming on forth
My beautiful comrade from the north"
Señor (Tales of Yankee Power),Señor (Tales of Yankee Power),Bob Dylan,"Señor, señor
Can you tell me where we're headin'
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon
Seems like I been down this way before
Is there any truth in that, señor

Señor, señor
Do you know where she's hidin'
How long are we gonna be riding
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door
Will there be any comfort there, señor

There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck
And there's an iron cross still hanging from around her neck
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Where's she held me in her arms one time and said
""Forget me not""

Señor, señor
I can see that painted wagon
Smell the tail of the dragon
I can't stand the suspense here anymore
Can you tell me who to contact here, señor

Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
And a gypsy with a broken flag and flashing ring
Said ""Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing""

Señor, señor
You know their hearts are hard as leather
Give me a minute, let me get it together
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor

And disconnect these cables
This place don't make sense to me no more
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, señor"
Shake Shake Mama,Shake Shake Mama,Bob Dylan,"I get the blues for you, baby, when I look up at the sun
I get the blues for you, baby, when I look up at the sun
Come back here, we can have some real fun

Well, it's early in the evening, and everything is still
Well, it's early in the evening, and everything is still
One more time, I'm walking up on heartbreak hill

Shake, shake, mama; like a ship going out to sea
Shake, shake, mama; like a ship going out to sea
You took all my money and you give it to Richard Lee

Down by the river, Judge Simpson walking around
Down by the river, Judge Simpson walking a-round
Nothing shocks me more than that old clown

Some of you women, you really know your stuff
Some of you women, you really know your stuff
But your clothes are all torn
And your language is a little too rough
Shake, shake, mama; shake it til the break of day
Shake, shake, mama; shake it til the break of day
I'm right here, baby, I'm not that far away

I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too
I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too
It's Friday morning on Franklin Avenue

Shake, shake, mama; raise your voice and pray
Shake, shake, mama; raise your voice and pray
If you're goin on home, ya better go the shortest way"
She Belongs to Me,She Belongs to Me,Bob Dylan,"She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She can take the dark out of the nighttime
And paint the daytime black

You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
Down upon your knees

She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall
She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall
She's nobody's child
The Law can't touch her at all

She wears an Egyptian ring
It sparkles before she speaks
She wears an Egyptian ring
It sparkles before she speaks
She's a hypnotist collector
You are a walking antique

Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween buy her a trumpet
And for Christmas get her a drum"
Shelter from the Storm,Shelter from the Storm,Bob Dylan,"'Twas in another lifetime
One of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue
The road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness
A creature void of form
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

And if I pass this way again
You can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her
On that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death and men
Who are fighting to be warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

Not a word was spoke between us
There was little risk involved
Everything up to that point
Had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place
Where it's always safe and warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""
I was burned out from exhaustion
Buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes
And blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile
Ravaged in the corn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

Suddenly I turned around
And she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists
And flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully
And took my crown of thorns
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

Now there's a wall between us
Something there's been lost
I took too much for granted
I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began
On an uneventful morn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""
Well the deputy walks on hard nails
And the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much
It's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker
He blows a futile horn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm

I've heard newborn babies wailing
Like a mourning dove
And old men with broken teeth
Stranded without love
Do I understand your question, then
Is it hopeless and forlorn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

In a little hilltop village
They gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation
And she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence
And I got repaid with scorn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""
Well, I'm living in a foreign country
But I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge
Someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock
To when God and her were born
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm"""
Shenandoah,Shenandoah,Bob Dylan,"Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Look away, you rolling river
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Look away. We're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

Now the Missouri is a mighty river
Look away, you rolling river
Indians camp along her border
Look away. We're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

Well a white man loved an Indian maiden
Look away, you rolling river
With notions his canoe was laden
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Look away, you rolling river
It was for her I'd cross the water
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri
For seven long years I courted Sally
Look away, you rolling river
Seven more years I longed to have her
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

Well, it's fare-thee-well, my dear
I'm bound to leave you
Look away you rolling river
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri"
She’s No Good,She's No Good,Bob Dylan,"Well, I don't know why I love you like I do
Nobody in the world can get along with you
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be
When you get a crazy notion jumpin' all over me
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
An' you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama
I helped you when you had no food to eat
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand
You're takin' all my money and give it to another man
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die"
She’s Your Lover Now,She's Your Lover Now,Bob Dylan,"The pawnbroker roared
Also, so, so did the landlord
The scene was so crazy, wasn’t it?
Both were so glad
To watch me destroy what I had
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn’t it?
Why didn’t you just leave me if you didn’t want to stay?
Why’d you have to treat me so bad?
Did it have to be that way?
Now you stand here expectin’ me to remember something’ you forgot to say
Yes, and you, I see you’re still with her, well
That’s fine ’cause she’s comin’ on so strange, can’t you tell?
Somebody had better explain
She’s got her iron chain
I’d do it, but I, I just can’t remember how
You talk to her
She’s your lover now

I already assumed
That we’re in the felony room
But I ain’t a judge, you don’t have to be nice to me
But please tell that
To your friend in the cowboy hat
You know he keeps on saying’ everything’ twice to me
You know I was straight with you
You know I’ve never tried to change you in any way
You know if you didn’t want to be with me
That you could, didn’t have to stay
Now you stand here sayin’ you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Yes, you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays, can’t you reach?
I see you kiss her on the cheek ev’rytime she gives a speech
With her picture books of the pyramid
And her postcards of Billy the Kid (why must everybody bow?)
You better talk to her ’bout it
You’re her lover now
Oh, everybody that cares
Is going up the castle stairs
But I’m not up in your castle, honey
It’s true, I just can’t recall
San Francisco at all
I can’t even remember El Paso, uh, honey
You never had to be faithful
I never wanted you to grieve
Oh, why was it so hard for you
If you didn’t want to be with me, just to leave?
Now you stand here while your finger’s going’ up my sleeve
An’ you, just what do you do anyway?
Ain’t there nothing’ you can say?
She’ll be standing’ on the bar soon
With a fish head and a harpoon
And a fake beard plastered on her brow
You’d better do something quick
She’s your lover now

Oh, why must I fall into this sadness?
Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Do you think I still got what you still got baby?
My voice is really warm
It's just there, it ain't got no form
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby
Ah, your mouth used to be so naked
Your eyes used to be so blue
Your hurts used to be so nameless
And your tears used to be so few
Now your mouth cries wolf
While... (What?)"
Shooting Star,Shooting Star,Bob Dylan,"Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of you
You were trying to break into another world
A world I never knew
I always kind of wondered
If you ever made it through
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of you

Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me
If I was still the same
If I ever became what you wanted me to be
Did I miss the mark or overstep the line
That only you could see?
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me

Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
As the last fire truck from hell
Goes rolling by
All good people are praying
It’s the last temptation, the last account
The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount
The last radio is playing
Seen a shooting star tonight
Slip away
Tomorrow will be
Another day
Guess it’s too late to say the things to you
That you needed to hear me say
Seen a shooting star tonight
Slip away"
Shot of Love,Shot of Love,Bob Dylan,"I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love

Don’t need a shot of heroin to kill my disease
Don’t need a shot of turpentine, only bring me to my knees
Don’t need a shot of codeine to help me to repent
Don’t need a shot of whiskey, help me be president


Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it’s making me feel afraid
What I got ain’t painful, it’s just bound to kill me dead
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head


I don’t need no alibi when I’m spending time with you
I’ve heard all of them rumors and you have heard them too
Don’t show me no picture show or give me no book to read
It don’t satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that it feeds

Why would I want to take your life?
You’ve only murdered my father, raped his wife
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends


Don’t want to be with nobody tonight
Veronica not around nowhere, Mavis just ain’t right
There’s a man that hates me and he’s swift, smooth and near
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he’s here?


What makes the wind want to blow tonight?
Don’t even feel like crossing the street and my car ain’t actin’ right
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away
My conscience is beginning to bother me today


I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
If you’re a doctor, I need a shot of love"
Sign on the Cross,Sign on the Cross,Bob Dylan,"Now, I try, oh for so awfully long
An' I just try to be
An' now, oh it's a gold mine
But it's free
Yes, but I know in my head
That we're all so misled
And it's that old sign on the cross
That worries me
Now, when I was just a bawlin' lad
I saw what I wanted to be
An' it's all for the sake
Of that I should see
But I was lost on the land
As I heard that front door slam
And that old sign on the cross
Worries me
Well, it's that old sign on the cross
Well, it's that old key to the kingdom
Well, it's that old sign on the cross
Like used to be
But, when I hold my head so high
As I see my old friends go by
An' it's still that sign on the cross
That worries me
Well, it seems to be the sign on the cross
Every day, every night
See the sign on the cross just layin' up on top of the hill
Yes, we thought it might have disappeared long ago
But I'm here to tell you, friends that I'm afraid
It's lyin' there still
Yes, just a little time is all you need, you might say
But I don't know 'bout that any more
Because the bird is here and you might want to enter it
But, of course, the door might be closed
But I just would like to tell you one time
If I don't see you again, that the thing is
That the sign on the cross is the sign you might need the most
Well the sign on the cross
Is just a sign (??) too
Well, there is some in every prison
And there is some in the penitentiary, too
Oh, when your, when your days are numbered
And your nights are long
You might think you're weak
But I mean to say you're strong
Yes you are, if that sign on the cross
If it begins to worry you
Well, that's all right because sing a song
And all your troubles will pass right on through"

Looks like a-nothing but rain
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street
Hope that it don’t sleet

Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout
Have a bunch of kids who call me “Pa”

That must be what it’s all about"

Silver Bells,Silver Bells,Bob Dylan,"City sidewalk, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

City street lights, even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Soon it will be Christmas day"

She's sleeping here, right by my side
And in her right hand, a silver dagger
She says that I can't be your bride
All men are false, says my mother
They'll tell you wicked, loving lies
The very next evening, they'll court another
Leave you alone to pine and sigh
My daddy is a handsome devil
He's got a chain five miles long
And on every link a heart does dangle
Of another maid he's loved and wronged
Go court another tender maiden
And hope that she will be your wife
For I've been warned and I've decided
To sleep alone all of my life"

Ain't complaining 'bout what I got

Silvio
Silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
Silvio
I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know

Honest as the next jade rolling that stone
When I come knocking don't throw me no bone
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
If you don't like it you can leave me alone

I can snap my fingers and require the rain
From a clear blue sky and turn it off again
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain
And charm the whistle off an evening train
I give what I got until I got no more
I take what I get until I even the score
You know I love you and furthermore
When it's time to go you got an open door

I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain
You give something up for everything you gain
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain
Pay for your ticket and don't complain

One of these days and it won't be long
Going down in the valley and sing my song
I will sing it loud and sing it strong
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong"
Simple Twist Of Fate [At Budokan],Simple Twist Of Fate [At Budokan],Bob Dylan,"They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and?he?felt a spark?tingle to his bones
’Twas then he?felt alone and wished that he’d gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate
They walked along by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin’ bright
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate
A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walkin’ by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin’ up
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate
He woke up, the room was bare
He didn’t see her anywhere
He told himself he didn’t care, pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate
He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in
Maybe she’ll pick him out again, how long must he wait
Once more for a simple twist of fate
People tell me it’s a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring
She was born in spring, but I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate"

Yes, my temperature rises and my feet don’t walk so fast
Well, this Arabian doctor came in, gave me a shot
But wouldn’t tell me if what I had would last

Well, this woman I’ve got, she’s filling me with her drive

Oh, why should I worry
Or crave you in vain?
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world

Went to the station
Down in the yard
Gonna get me a freight train
Work's done got hard
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world

The lonesome days
They have gone by
Why should I beg you?
You said good-bye
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world"
Skylark,Skylark,Bob Dylan,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?
Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane
And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon
Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?
Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?"
Slow Train,Slow Train,Bob Dylan,"Sometimes
I feel so low-down and disgusted
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions
Are they lost or are they found?
Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
All their earthly principles they're going to have to abandon?
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

I had a woman
Down in Alabama
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic
She said, ""Boy, without a doubt
Have to quit your mess and straighten out
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic""
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

All that foreign oil
Controlling American soil
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed
Sheiks walking around like kings
Wearing fancy jewels and nose rings
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam and Paris
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend
Man's ego is inflated
His laws are outdated,
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting
In the home of the brave
Jefferson turning over in his grave
Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

Big-time negotiators
False healers and woman-haters
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition
But the enemy I see
Wears a cloak of decency
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

People starving and thirsting
Grain elevators are bursting
Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it
They say, ""Lose your inhibitions
Follow your own ambitions""
They talk about a life of brotherly love; show me someone who knows how to live it
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend
Well, my baby went to Illinois
With some bad-talking boy she could destroy
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it
I don't care about economy
I don't care about astronomy
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend"
Solid Rock,Solid Rock,Bob Dylan,"Well, I’m hanging on to a solid rock
Made before the foundation of the world
And I won’t let go, and I can’t let go, won’t let go
And I can’t let go, won’t let go and I can’t let go no more

For me He was chastised, for me He was hated
For me He was rejected by a world that He created
Nations are angry, cursed are some
People are expecting a false peace to come


It’s the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it
Using all the devices under the sun
And He never give up ’til the battle’s lost or won"
Some Enchanted Evening,Some Enchanted Evening,Bob Dylan,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
And somehow you knew, you know even then
That somehow you'll see her again and again
Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room
And night after night, as strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams
Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try
Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you feel her call you across a crowded room
Then fly to her side and make her your own
Or all through your life you may dream all alone
Once that you found her, never let her go
Once you have found her, never let her go"
Somebody Touched Me,Somebody Touched Me,Bob Dylan,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!
Would you please welcome Columbia recording artist Bob Dylan
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Must have been the hand of the lord
While I was praying, somebody touched me
While I was praying, somebody touched me
While I was praying, somebody touched me
Must have been the hand of the lord
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me

Someday Baby,Someday Baby,Bob Dylan,"I don't care what you do, I don't care what you say
I don't care where you go or how long you stay
Someday baby, you are not going to worry po' me any more

Well you take my money and you turn me out
You fill me up with nothing but self doubt
Someday baby, you are not going to worry po' me anymore

When I was young, driving was my grave
You drive me so hard, almost to the grave
Someday baby, you are not going to worry po' me anymore

I'm so hard pressed, my mind tied up in knots
I keep recycling the same old thoughts
Someday baby you are not going to worry Po' me anymore

So many good things in life that I overlooked
I don't know what to do now, you got me so hooked
Someday baby you are not going to worry po' me any more

Well, I don't want to brag, but I'm going to ring your neck
When all else fails I'll make it a matter of self-respect
Someday baby, you are not going to worry Po' me any more
You can take your clothes put him in a sack
You gain' down the road, baby and you can't come back
Someday baby you are not going to worry po' me any more

I try to be friendly, I try to be kind
Now I'm gonna drive you from your home, just like I was driven from mine
Someday baby you are not going to worry po' me any more

Living this way is not a natural thing to do
Why was I born to love you?
Someday baby, you are not going to worry po' me any more"
Someone’s Got a Hold of My Heart,Someone’s Got a Hold of My Heart,Bob Dylan,"They say, “Eat, drink and be merry
Take the bull by the horns”
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns
Everything looks a little far away to me

Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap
Too much information about nothing
Too much educated rap
It’s just like you told me, just like you said it would be

The moon rising like wildfire
I feel the breath of a storm
Something I got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm

Someone’s got a hold of my heart
Someone’s got a hold of my heart
Someone’s got a hold of my heart
You
Yeah, you got a hold of my heart

Just got back from a city of flaming red skies
Everybody thinks with their stomach
There’s plenty of spies
Every street is crooked, they just wind around till they disappear
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Like an ancient river
So wide and deep
She said, “Be easy, baby, ain’t nothin’ worth stealing in here”

You’re the one I’ve been waiting for
You’re the one I desire
But you must first realize
I’m not another man for hire


I can hear that hot-blooded singer
On the bandstand croon
Poisoned Love, Red Roses for a Blue Lady and Memphis in June
While they’re beating the devil out of a guy who’s wearing a powder blue wig

I been to Babylon
I gotta confess
I could still hear the voice crying in the wilderness
What looks large from a distance, close up is never that big
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine"
Something There Is About You,Something There Is About You,Bob Dylan,"Something there is about you that strikes a match in me
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be
Something’ that crossed over from another century?

Thought I’d shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walk-in’ the hills of old Duluth
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth

Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings
Don’t have to look no further, you’re the soul of many things
I could say that I’d be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death

Something there is about you that moves with style and grace
I was in a whirlwind, now I’m in some better place
My hand’s on the sabre and you’ve picked up the baton
Something’ there is about you that I can’t quite put my finger on"
"Something’s Burning, Baby","Something's Burning, Baby",Bob Dylan,"Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Something is the matter, baby, there’s smoke in your hair
Are you still my friend, baby, show me a sign
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?

You’ve been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while
The truth that I’m seeking is in your missing file
What’s your position, baby, what’s going on?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?

I know everything about this place, or so it seems
Am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed
What’s happening, baby, to make you act so strange?

Something is burning, baby, here’s what I say
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn’t find you today
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue
Who is he, baby, and what’s he to you?

We’ve reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
I can feel it in the night when I think of you
I can feel it in the light and it’s got to be true
You can’t live by bread alone, you won’t be satisfied
You can’t roll away the stone if your hands are tied

Got to start someplace, baby, can you explain?
Please don’t fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train
Answer me, baby, a casual look will do
Just what in the world has come over you?

I can feel it in the wind and it’s upside down
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town
I’ve had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve
I don’t want to see you bleed, I know what you need but it is not what you deserve

Something is burning, baby, something’s in flames
There’s a man going around calling names
Ring down when you’re ready, baby, I’m waiting for you
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do"
Somewhere Along the Way,Somewhere Along the Way,Bob Dylan,"I used to walk with you
Along the avenue
Our hearts were carefree and gay
How could I know I'd lose you
Somewhere along the way?
The friends we used to know
Would always smile ""Hello""
No love like our love they'd say
Then love slipped through our fingers
Somewhere along the way
I should forget
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering ev'rything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be part of me
So now I look for you
Along the avenue
And as I wander I pray
That some day soon I'll find you
Somewhere along the way
I should forget
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering ev'rything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be part of me
So now I look for you
Along the avenue
And as I wander I pray
That some day soon I'll find you
Somewhere along the way
Somewhere along the way"
Song to Woody,Song to Woody,Bob Dylan,"I’m out here a thousand miles from my home
Walking a road other men have gone down
I’m seeing your world of people and things
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
About a funny old world that’s a-coming along
Seems sick and it’s hungry, it’s tired and it’s torn
It looks like it’s a-dying and it’s hardly been born
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
All the things that I’m a-saying an a-many times more
I’m a-singing you the song, but I can’t sing enough
Because there’s not many men that done the things that you’ve done
Here’s to Cisco and Sonny and Leadbelly too
And to all the good people that traveled with you
Here’s to the hearts and the hands of the men
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind
I’m a-leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today
Somewhere down the road someday
The very last thing that I’d want to do
Is to say I’ve been hitting some hard traveling too"
Soon after Midnight,Soon after Midnight,Bob Dylan,"I'm searching for phrases
To sing your praises
I need to tell someone
It's soon after midnight
And my day has just begun

A gal named Honey
Took my money
She was passing by
It's soon after midnight
And the moon is in my eye

My heart is cheerful
It's never fearful
I've been down on the killing floors
I'm in no great hurry
I'm not afraid of your fury
I've faced stronger walls than yours

Charlotte's a harlot
Dresses in scarlet
Mary dresses in green
It's soon after midnight
And I've got a date with the fairy queen
They chirp and they chatter
What does it matter?
They're lying there dying in their blood
Two-timing Slim
Who's ever heard of him
I'll drag his corpse through the mud

It's now or never
More than ever
When I met you I didn't think you would do
It's soon after midnight
And I don't want nobody but you"
Spanish Harlem Incident,Spanish Harlem Incident,Bob Dylan,"Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Cannot hold you to its heat
Your temperature is too hot for taming
Your flaming feet are burning up the street
I'm homeless, come and take me
To the reach of your rattlin' drums
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Down along my restless palms

Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed
I have fallen far beneath
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing
And your flashing diamond teeth
The night is pitch black, come an’ make my
Pale face fit into place, ah, please!
Let me know, babe, I’m nearly drowning
If it’s you my lifelines trace

I been wondering all about me
Ever since I seen you there
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I’m riding
I know I’m around you but I don’t know where
You have slayed me, you have made me
I got to laugh half ways off my heels
I got to know, babe, yeah will you surround me?
So I can know if I’m really real"
Spanish Is the Loving Tongue,Spanish Is the Loving Tongue,Bob Dylan,"Broke my heart, lost my soul
Adios, mi corazon
Spanish is the loving tongue
Soft as music, light as spring
It was a girl I learned it from
Living down Sonora way
Well, I don't look much like a lover
Still I say her love words over
Mostly when I'm all alone
Mi amor, mi Cora sole

Haven't seen her since that night
I can't cross the line you know
They want me for a gambling fight
Like as not it's better so
Still I always kind of missed her
Since that last sad night I kissed her
Broke her heart, lost my own
Adios, mi Corazon
Broke her heart, lost my own
Adios, mi Corazon
Adios, mi Corazon
Adios, mi Corazon"
Spirit on the Water,Spirit on the Water,Bob Dylan,"Spirit on the water
Darkness on the face of the deep
I keep thinking about you baby
I can't hardly sleep

I'm traveling by land
Traveling through the dawn of day
You're always on my mind
I can't stay away

I'd forgotten about you
Then you turned up again
I always knew
That we were meant to be more than friends

When you are near
It's just as plain as it can be
I'm wild about you, gal
You ought to be a fool about me

Can't explain
The sources of this hidden pain
You burned your way into my heart
You got the key to my brain
I've been trampling through mud
Praying to the powers above
I'm sweating blood
You got a face that begs for love

Life without you
Doesn't mean a thing to me
If I can't have you
I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea

Sometimes I wonder
Why you can't treat me right
You do good all day
Then you do wrong all night

When you're with me
I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say
What does it matter
What price I pay

They brag about your sugar
Brag about it all over town
Put some sugar in my bowl
I feel like laying down
I'm pale as a ghost
Holding a blossom on a stem
You ever seen a ghost? No
But you have heard of them

I see you there
I'm blinded by the colors I see
I take good care
Of what belongs to me

I hear your name
Ringing up and down the line
I'm saying it plain
These ties are strong enough to bind

Your sweet voice
Calls out from some old familiar shrine
I got no choice
Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind

I could live forever
With you perfectly
You don't ever
Have to make a fuss over me
From East to West
Ever since the world began
I only mean it for the best
I want to be with you any way I can

I been in a brawl
Now I'm feeling the wall
I'm going away baby
I won't be back ‘till fall

High on the hill
You can carry all my thoughts with you
You've numbed my will
This love could tear me in two

I wanna be with you in paradise
And it seems so unfair
I can't go to paradise no more
I killed a man back there

You think I'm over the hill
You think I'm past my prime
Let me see what you got
We can have a whoppin' good time"
Stack A Lee,Stack A Lee,Bob Dylan,"Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight
All about that John B. Stetson hat

Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room, and he called for a glass of beer
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, ""What are you doin' here?""
""Waitin' for a train, please bring my woman home

""Stack-A-Lee, oh Stack-A-Lee. please don't take my life
Got three little children and a-weepin', lovin' wife

You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee.""
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Taking him to the cemetery, buy they failed to bring him back
All about that John B. Stetson hat

Hawlin Alley, thought I heard the bulldogs bark
It must have been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail

High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, and he jumped forty feet
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail

Well they got old Stack-A-Lee and they laid him right back in jail
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail
All about that John B. Stetson hat

Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, ""Jailer, I can't sleep
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons began to creep.""

Stage Fright,Stage Fright,Bob Dylan,"Now deep in the heart of a lonely kid
Who suffered so much for what he did
They gave this ploughboy his fortune and fame
Since that day he ain't been the same
See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might
And he got caught in the spotlight
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again
I've got fire water right on my breath
And the doctor warned me I might catch a death
Said, ""You can make it in your disguise
Just never show the fear that's in your eyes""
See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might
He got caught in the spotlight
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again
Now if he says that he's afraid
Take him at his word
And for the price that the poor boy has paid
He gets to sing just like a bird, oh, ooh ooh ooh
Your brow is sweatin' and your mouth gets dry
Fancy people go driftin' by
The moment of truth is right at hand
Just one more nightmare you can stand
See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might
And he got caught in the spotlight
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again, hmm hmm
You wanna try it once again, hmm hmm
Please don't make him stop, hmm hmm
Let him take it from the top, hmm hmm
Let him start all over again"
Standing in the Doorway,Standing in the Doorway,Bob Dylan,"I'm walking through the summer nights
The jukebox playing low
Yesterday everything was going too fast
Today it's moving too slow
I got no place left to turn
I got nothing left to burn
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
I got nothing to go back to now

The light in this place is so bad
Making me sick in the head
All the laughter is just making me sad
The stars have turned cherry red
I'm strumming on my gay guitar
Smoking a cheap cigar
The ghost of our old love has not gone away
Don't look it like it will anytime soon
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Under the midnight moon
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't
But not tonight and it won't be here
There are things I could say, but I don't
I know the mercy of God must be near
I've been riding a midnight train
Got ice water in my veins
I would be crazy if I took you back
It would go up against every rule
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Suffering like a fool

When the last rays of daylight go down
Buddy, you’ll roll no more
I can hear the church bells ringing in the yard
I wonder who they're ringing for
I know I can't win
But my heart just won't give in
Last night I danced with a stranger
But she just reminded me you were the one
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
In the dark land of the sun
I eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry
And live my life on the square
And even if the flesh falls off of my face
I know someone will be there to care
It always means so much
Even the softest touch
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation
There's no words that need to be said
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Blues wrapped around my head"

Stardust,Stardust,Bob Dylan,"Sometimes I wonder
Why I spend my lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
Oh, but that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
Beside the garden wall, when stars were bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale told his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart, it will always remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain"
Stay with Me,Stay with Me,Bob Dylan,"Should my heart not be humble
Should my eyes fail to see
Should my feet sometimes stumble
On the way, stay with me
Like the lamb that in springtime
Wanders far from the fold
Comes the darkness and the frost
I get lost, I grow cold
I grow cold, I grow weary, and I know I have sinned
And I go seeking shelter and I cry in the wind
And though I grope and I blunder and I'm weak and I'm wrong
Though the road buckles under where I walk, walk along
Till I find to my wonder every path leads to thee
All that I can do is pray, stay with me
Stay with me"

Stormy Weather,Stormy Weather,Bob Dylan,"Don't know why
Theres no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I
Ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time
The time
So weary all the time
When she went away
The blues walked in and they met
If she stays away that old rocking chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray the Lord above is gonna let me
Walk in the sun once more
Can't go on
Everything I have is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I
Ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the time
Backing singers:
When she went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away that old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more
Can't go on
Everything I have is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I
Ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
The time
Keeps raining all the time"
Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again,Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again,Bob Dylan,"(Intro)
Oh, the ragman draws circles
Up and down the block
I’d ask him what the matter was
But I know that he don’t talk
And the ladies treat me kindly
And they furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart
I know I can't escape
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Well, Shakespeare, he’s in the alley
With his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl
Who says she knows me well
And I would send a message
To find out if she’s talked
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Mona tried to tell me
To stay away from the train line
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine
And I said, “Oh, I didn’t know that
But then again, there’s only one I’ve met
And he just smoked my eyelids
And punched my cigarette”
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Grandpa died last week
And now he’s buried in the rocks
But everybody still talks about
How badly they were shocked
But me, I expected it to happen
I knew he’d lost control
When I, he built a fire on Main Street
And shot it full of holes
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Now the senator came down here
Showing everyone his gun
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son
And me, I nearly got busted
And wouldn’t it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck
Oh, Mama, is this really the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Now the tea preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved to him
Then I whispered, said “Not even you can hide
You see, you’re just like me
I hope you’re satisfied”
Aw, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Now the rainman gave me two cures
Then he said, “Jump right in”
The one was Texas medicine
The other was just railroad gin
And like a fool I mixed them
And it strangled up my mind
And now people just get uglier
And I have no sense of time
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
When Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free
’Neath her Panamanian moon
And I say, “Aw come on now
You know ya' know about my debutante”
And she says, “Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want”
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly
It all seems so well timed
And here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all these things twice
Oh, Mama, is this really the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again"
Subterranean Homesick Blues,Subterranean Homesick Blues,Bob Dylan,"Johnny's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine
I'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
Look out kid, it's somethin' you did
God knows when, but you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen
Wants 11 dollar bills – you only got 10

Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed, but
Phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says the many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A
Look out kid, don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes, don’t tie no bows
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well
Hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail
Get jailed, jump bail, join the Army if you fail
Look out kid, you're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters, six-time users
Hanging 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, a-watch the parking meters
Oh, get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance
Learn to dance, get dressed
Get blessed, try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift
Look out kid, they keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
Don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles"
Sugar Baby,Sugar Baby,Bob Dylan,"I got my back to the sun ’cause the light is too intense
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
You can’t turn back—you can’t come back, sometimes we push too far
One day you’ll open up your eyes and you’ll see where we are
Sugar Baby get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide ’em bad enough
I’m staying with Aunt Sally, but you know, she’s not really my aunt
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of them you can’t
Sugar Baby get on down the line
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
You might as well keep going now
The ladies down in Darktown, they’re doing the Darktown Strut
You always got to be prepared but you never know for what
There ain’t no limit to the amount of trouble women bring
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love’s not an evil thing
Sugar Baby, get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
You might as well keep going now
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes, you just end up making it a thousand times worse
Sugar Baby, get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one
You got a way of tearing the world apart. Love, see what you done
Just as sure as we’re living, just as sure as you’re born
Look up, look up—seek your Maker—’fore Gabriel blows his horn
Sugar Baby, get on down the line
You ain’t got no sense, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now"
Summer Days,Summer Days,Bob Dylan,"Summer days, summer nights are gone
Summer days and the summer nights are gone
I know a place where there’s still something going on
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs all out in the mud
Got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood
Everybody get ready to lift up your glasses and sing
Everybody get ready to lift up your glasses and sing
Well, I’m standing on the table, I’m proposing a toast to the king

Well I’m driving in the flats in a Cadillac car
The girls all say, “You’re a worn-out star”
My pockets are loaded and I’m spending every dime
How can you say you love someone else when you know it’s me all the time?

Well, the fog’s so thick you can’t spy the land
The fog is so thick that you can’t even spy the land
What good are you anyway, if you can’t stand up to some old businessman?
Wedding bells are ringing, the choir is beginning to sing
Yes, the wedding bells are ringing and the choir's beginning to sing
What looked good in the day, at night is another thing
She’s looking into my eyes, she’s-a holding my hand
She looking into my eyes, she’s holding my hand
She said, “You can’t repeat the past,” I said, “You can’t? What do you mean
You can’t? Of course you can.”

Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Sorry that’s nothing you would need to know
Well, my back has been to the wall for so long, it seems like it’s stuck
Why don’t you break my heart one more time just for good luck?

I got eight carburetors, boys I’m using ’em all
Well, I got eight carburetors and boys, I’m using ’em all
I’m short on gas, my motor’s starting to stall
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain’t going down
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace
If it’s information you want you can go get it from the police

Politician's got on his jogging shoes
He must be running for office, got no time to lose
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity
You been rolling your eyes—you been teasing me

Standing by God’s river, my soul is beginning to shake
Standing by God’s river, my soul is beginning to shake
I’m counting on you love, to give me a break
Well, I’m leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift
Yes, I’m leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift
Gonn' break the roof in—set fire to the place as a parting gift
Summer days, summer nights are gone
Summer days, summer nights are gone
I know a place where there’s still something going on"
Sweetheart Like You,Sweetheart Like You,Bob Dylan,"Well, the pressure’s down, the boss ain't here
He gone North, for a while
They say that vanity got the best of him
But he sure left here in style
By the way, that’s a cute hat
And that smile’s so hard to resist
But what’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you
She wanted a whole man, not just a half
She used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a child
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear
It’s done with a flick of the wrist
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

You know, a woman like you should be at home
That’s where you belong
Watching out for someone who loves you true
Who would never do you wrong
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Well, there’s no way to tell by that first kiss
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
You know you can make a name for yourself
You can hear them tires squeal
You can be known as the most beautiful woman
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal

You know, news of you has come down the line
Even before you came in the door
They say in your father’s house, there’s many mansions
Each one of them got a fireproof floor
Snap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

Got to be an important person to be in here, honey
Got to have done some evil deed
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed

They say that patriotism is the last refuge
To which a scoundrel clings
Steal a little and they throw you in jail
Steal a lot and they make you king
There’s only one step down from here, baby
It’s called the land of permanent bliss
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?"

T.V. Talkin’ Song,T.V. Talkin' Song,Bob Dylan,"One time in London I’d gone out for a walk
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
’Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view
To anyone passing by, that’s who they’re talking to

There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
About the T.V. god and all the pain that it invokes
“It’s too bright a light,” he said, “for anybody’s eyes
If you’ve never seen one it’s a blessing in disguise”

I moved in closer, got up on my toes
Two men in front of me were coming to blows
The man was saying something ’bout children when they’re young
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung

“The news of the day is on all the time
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free
Don’t let an egg get laid in it by something you can’t see”

“Pray for peace!” he said. You could feel it in the crowd
My thoughts began to wander. His voice was ringing loud
“It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on”
“It will lead you into some strange pursuits
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits
It will scramble up your head and drag your brain about
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out”

“It’s all been designed,” he said, “to make you lose your mind
And when you go back to find it, there’s nothing there to find
Every time you look at it, your situation’s worse
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse""

The crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man
There was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran
The T.V. crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me
Later on that evening, I watched it on T.V"
Take Me As I Am (Or Let Me Go),Take Me As I Am (Or Let Me Go),Bob Dylan,"Why must you always try to make me over ?
Take me as I am or let me go
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover
Take me as I am or let me go

You're trying to reshape me in a moment
In the image of someone you used to know
I won't be a stand-in for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go

You've tried to change me ever since you've met me
Take me as I am or let me go
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me
Take me as I am or let me go

You're trying to reshape me in a mould love
In the image of someone you used to know
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go"
Take a Message to Mary,Take a Message to Mary,Bob Dylan,"These are the words of a frontier lad
Who lost his love when he turned bad

Take a message to Mary
But don't tell here where I am
Take a message to Mary
But don't say I'm in a jam
You can tell her that I had to see the world
Tell her that my ship set sail
You can say she'd better not wait for me
But don't tell her I'm in jail, oh don't tell her I'm in jail

Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her what I've done
Please, don't mention the stage coach
And the shot from a carried gun
You better tell her that I had to change my plans
And cancel out the wedding-day
But please, don't mention the lonely cell
Where I'm gonna pine away, until my dying-day

Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her all you know
My heart is aching for Mary
Lord know I miss her so
Just tell her that I went to Timbukto
Tell her I'm searching for gold
You can say she better find someone new
To cherish and to hold, oh Lord, this cell is so cold"

Bear Mountain picnic was comin' my way
""Come along 'n' take a trip
We'll bring you up there on a ship
Bring the wife and kids
Bring the whole family.""
Yippee!
Well, I run right down 'n' bought a ticket
To this Bear Mountain Picnic
But little did I realize
I was in for a picnic surprise
Had nothin' to do with mountains
I didn't even come close to a bear
Took the wife 'n' kids down to the pier
Six thousand people there
Everybody had a ticket for the trip
""Oh well."" I said, ""it's a pretty big ship
Besides, anyway, the more the merrier.""
Well, we all got on 'n' what d'ya think
That big old boat started t' sink
More people kept a-pilin' on
That old ship was a-slowly goin' down
Maybe we just better call off the picnic
No, the word there is uh instead of maybe better call off the picnic, it's
Funny way t' start a picnic
Well, I soon lost track of m' kids 'n' wife
So many people there I never saw in m' life
That old ship sinkin' down in the water
Six thousand people tryin' t' kill each other
Dogs a-barkin', cats a-meowin'
Women a-screamin', fists a-flyin', babies cryin'
Cops a-comin', me a-runnin'
Maybe we just better call off the picnic
I got shoved down 'n' pushed around
All I could hear there was a screamin' sound
Don't remember one thing more
Just remember walkin' up on a little shore
Head busted, stomach cracked
Feet splintered, I was bald, naked...
Quite lucky to be alive though
Feelin' like I climbed outa m' casket
I grabbed back hold of m' picnic basket
Took the wife 'n' kids 'n' started home
Wishin' I'd never got up that morn
Now, I don't care just what you do
If you wanta have a picnic, that's up t' you
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanta hear it
'Cause, see, I just lost all m' picnic spirit
Stay in m' kitchen, have m' own picnic's there...
In the bedroom, In the bathroom
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
What some people are gonna do f'r money
There's a bran' new gimmick every day
Just t' take somebody's money away
I think we oughta take some o' these people
And put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain...

Talking World War III Blues,Talking World War III Blues,Bob Dylan,"Some time ago a crazy dream came to me
I dreamt, I was walkin' into World War III
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kinda words he could say
He said, ""It was a bad dream""
I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though
They were my own dreams
And they're only in my head
I said, ""Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain""
He said, ""Nurse, get your pad, this boy's insane""
He grabbed my arm, I said ""Ouch""
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said, ""Tell me about it""
Well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast
It was all over by quarter past
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wonderin' who turned the lights on us
Well, I got up and walked around
And up and down the lonesome town
I stood a-wonderin' which way to go
I lit a cigarette on a parkin' meter
And walked on down the road, it was a normal day
Well, I rung me fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I gave a yell
""Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man""
Shotgun fired and away I ran
I don't blame 'em too much though
They didn't know me
Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand
I seen a man, I said, ""Howdy friend
I guess there's just us two""
He screamed a bit and away he flew
Thought I was a communist
Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave
Say, ""Let's go and play Adam and Eve""
I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'
When she said, ""Hey man, you crazy or sumpin'
You see what happened last time they started""
Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown
And there was nobody aroun'
I got into the driver's seat
And I drove down 42nd street, in my Cadillac
Good car to drive after a war
Well, I remember seein' some ad
So I turned on my Conelrad
But I didn't pay my Con Ed bill
So the radio didn't work so well
Turned on my player
It was rock-a-day, Johnny singin'
""Tell your ma, tell your pa
Our loves are gonna grow ooh-wah, ooh-wah""
I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue
I needed somebody to talk to
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind
""When you hear the beep, it will be three o'clock""
She said that for over an hour and I hung it up
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then
Sayin', ""Hey, I've been havin' the same old dreams
But mine was a little different you see
I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me
I didn't see you around""
Well, now time passed and now it seems
Everybody's havin' them dreams
Everybody sees themselves
Walkin' around with no one else
Half of the people can be part right all of the time
Some of the people can be all right part of the time
But all of the people can't be all right all of the time
I think Abraham Lincoln said that
""I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours""
I said that"

I didn’t know what in the world I wus gonna do
Them Communists they was coming around
They was in the air
They was on the ground
They wouldn’t give me no peace

So I run down most hurriedly
And joined up with the John Birch Society
I got me a secret membership card
And started off a-walking down the road
Yee-hoo, I’m a real John Bircher now!
Look out you Commies!

Now we all agree with Hitler’s views
Although he killed six million Jews
It don’t matter too much that he was a Fascist
At least you can’t say he was a Communist!
That’s to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria

Well, I woos looking everywhere for them gol-darned Reds
I got up in the morning and looked under my bed
Looked in the sink, behind the door
Looked in the glove compartment of my car
Couldn’t find them
I woos looking high and low for them Reds everywhere
I woos looking in the sink and underneath the chair
I looked way up my chimney hole
I even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl
They got away

Well, I woos sitting home alone and started to sweat
Figured they woos in my T.V. set
Peeked behind the picture frame
Got a shock from my feet, hitting right up in the brain
Them Reds caused it!
I know they did them hard-core ones

Well, I quit my job so I could work all alone
Then I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes
Followed some clues from my detective bag
And discovered they woos red stripes on the American flag!
That old Betsy Ross

Well, I investigated all the books in the library
Ninety percent of them gotta be burned away
I investigated all the people that I know
Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go
The other two percent are fellow Birchers just like me
Now Eisenhower, he’s a Russian spy
Lincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy
To my knowledge there’s just one man
That’s really a true American: George Lincoln Rockwell
I know for a fact he hates Commies because he picketed the movie Exodus

Well, I finally started thinking straight
When I run out of things to investigate
Couldn’t imagine doing anything else
So now I’m sitting home investigating myself!
Hope I don’t find out anything hmm, great God!"
Talkin’ New York,Talkin' New York,Bob Dylan,"Rambling out of the wild West
Leaving the towns I love the best
Thought I’d seen some ups and downs
'Til I come into New York town
People going down to the ground
Buildings going up to the sky

Wintertime in New York town
The wind blowing snow around
Walk around with nowhere to go
Somebody could freeze right to the bone
I froze right to the bone
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
I didn’t feel so cold then

I swung on to my old guitar
Grabbed hold of a subway car
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I landed up on the downtown side
Greenwich Village

I walked down there and ended up
In one of them coffeehouses on the block
Got on the stage to sing and play
Man there said, “Come back some other day
You sound like a hillbilly
We want folk singers here”
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day
I blowed inside out and upside down
The man there said he loved my sound
He was raving about how he loved my sound
Dollar a day’s worth

And after weeks and weeks of hanging around
I finally got a job in New York town
In a bigger place, bigger money too
Even joined the union and paid my dues

Now, a very great man once said
That some people rob you with a fountain pen
It didn’t take too long to find out
Just what he was talkin’ about
A lot of people don’t have much food on their table
But they got a lot of forks ’n’ knives
And they got to cut something

So one morning when the sun was warm
I rambled out of New York town
Pulled my cap down over my eyes
And headed out for the western skies
So long, New York
Howdy, East Orange"
Talkin’ World War III Blues,Talkin' World War III Blues,Bob Dylan,"One time ago a crazy dream came to me
I dreamt I was walking to World War Three
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kind of words he could say
He said it was a bad dream
""I wouldn’t worry about it none, though
Them old dreams are only in your head""

I said “Hold it Doc, a World War passed through my brain”
He said “Nurse, get your pad, the boy’s insane”
He grabbed my arm, I said “Ouch!”
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said “Tell me about it”

Well, the whole thing started at 3 o’clock fast
It was all over by a quarter past
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wondering who turned the lights on us

Well, I got up and I walked around
Up and down the lonesome town
I stood a-wondering which way to go
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
And walked on down the road
It was a normal day
Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I give a yell
“Give me a string bean, I’m a hungry man”
A shotgun fired, and away I ran
I don’t blame him too much though, he didn't know me

Down at the corner by the hot-dog stand
I seen a man
I said “Howdy friend, I guess there’s just us two”
He screamed a bit, and away he flew
Thought I was a Communist

Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave
I said “Let’s go and play Adam and Eve”
I took her by the hand, and my heart was thumping
When she said “Hey man, you crazy or something?
You seen what happened last time they started”

Well, I seen me a Cadillac window uptown
There was nobody around
I got into the driver’s seat
And I drove down 42nd Street
In my Cadillac
Good car to drive after a war
Well, I remember seeing some ad
So I turned on my Conelrad
But I didn’t pay the Con Ed bill
So the radio didn’t work so well
Turned on my record player —
It was Rock-a-day Johnny, singing “Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa
Our Love’s A-going to Grow, Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah”

I was feeling kind of lonesome and blue
I needed somebody to talk to
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind
“When you hear the beep it will be three o’clock”
She said that for over an hour
And I hung up

Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then
Saying “Hey I’ve been having the same old dreams
But mine was a little different, you see
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me
I didn’t see you around""

Well, now time passed and now it seems
Everybody’s having them dreams
Everybody sees their self
Walking around with no one else
""Half of the people can be part right all of the time
And some of the people can be all right part of the time
But all of the people can’t be all right all of the time""
I think Abraham Lincoln said that
“I’ll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours”
I said that"
Tangled Up in Blue,Tangled Up in Blue,Bob Dylan,"Early one morning the sun was shining
I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
""We'll meet again someday
On the avenue""
Tangled up in blue
I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I lucky was to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight, so clear
And later on, when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there, in back of my chair
Said to me ""Tell me, don't I know your name?""
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit, I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello"" she said
""You look like the silent type""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when it finally, the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
A-heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blue"
Tattle O’Day,Tattle O'Day,Bob Dylan,"I buyed me a little dog, color it was brown
I learned him to whistle, sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long, his ears they were quite broad
Around the world in half a day and on him I could ride
Sing taddle o day
I buyed me a little bull about four inches high
Everybody feared him that ever heard him cry
When he begins to bellow it made such melodious sound
Till all the walls in London came tumbling to the ground
Sing taddle o day
I buyed me a flock of sheep, I thought they were all wethers
Sometimes they yielded wool, sometimes they yielded feathers
I think mine are the very best sheep for yielding me increase
For every full and change of the moon they bring both lambs and geese
Sing taddle o day
I buyed me a little box about four acres square
I filled it full of guineas and silver so fair
Oh now I'm bound for Turkey, I'll travel like an ox
In my breeches pocket, I'll carry my little box
Sing taddle o day
I buyed me a little hen, all speckled gay and fair
I sat her on an oyster shell, she hatched me out a hare
The hare it sprang a handsome horse full fifteen hands high
And him that tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie
Sing taddle o day"
Tell Me,Tell Me,Bob Dylan,"Tell me--I’ve got to know
Tell me--tell me before I go
Does that flame still burn, Does that fire still glow
Or has it died out and melted like the snow
Tell me
Tell me

Tell me--what are you focused upon
Tell me--will it come to me after you're gone
Tell me quick with a glance or a sigh
Shall I hold you close or  let you go by
Tell me
Tell me

Is that the heat and the beat of your pulse that I feel
If it's not that then what are you tryin' to conceal
Do you have any secrets
That will only come out in time
Do you lay in your bed
Do you stare at the stars
Is your main friend someone who’s an old acquaintance of ours
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me--are those rock'n'roll dreams in your eyes
Tell me--behind what door your treasure lies
Ever gone broke in a big way
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say
Tell me
Tell me

Is this some kind of game that you’re playing’ with my heart
How deep must I go? When do I start?
Do you have any morals
Do you have any point of view
Is that a smile that I see on your face
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace
Tell me
Tell me

Tell me--is that man's name in your book
Tell me--will you go back and take another look
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies
Are you anybody's someone prays for or cries
Tell me
Tell me"
"Tell Ol’ Bill (Alternate Version, North Country Soundtrack)","Tell Ol’ Bill (Alternate Version, North Country Soundtrack)",Bob Dylan,"The river whispers in my ear
I've hardly a penny to my name
The heavens never seemed so near
All of my body glows with flame
The tempest struggles in the air
And to myself alone I sing
It could sink me then and there
I can hear the echoes ring
I tried to find one smiling face
To drive the shadow from my head
I'm stranded in this nameless place
Lying restless in a heavy bed
Tell me straight out if you will
Why must you torture me within?
Why must you come from your high hill?
Throw my fate to the clouds and wind
Far away in a silent land
Secret thoughts are hard to bear
Remember me, you'll understand
Emotions we can never share
You trampled on me as you passed
Left the coldest kiss upon my brow
All of my doubts and fears have gone at last
I've nothing more to tell you now
I walk by tranquil lakes and streams
As each new season's dawn awaits
I lay awake at night with troubled dreams
The enemy is at the gate
Beneath the thunder blasted trees
The words are ringin' off your tongue
The ground is hard in times like these
The stars are cold, the night is young
The rocks are bleak, the trees are bare
Iron clouds go floating by
Snowflakes fallin' in my hair
Beneath the gray and stormy sky
The evenin' sun is sinkin' low
The woods are dark, the town is too
They'll drag you down, they'll run the show
Ain't no telling what they'll do
Tell ol' Bill when he comes home
That anything is worth a try
Tell him that I'm not alone
And that the hour has come to do or die
All the world I would defy
Let me make it plain as day
I look at you now and I sigh
How could it be any other way?"
Tempest,Tempest,Bob Dylan,"The pale moon rose in its glory
Out o'er the Western town
She told a sad, sad story
Of the great ship that went down

T'was the fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a gilded age foretold

The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near

Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home

The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love
The watchman, he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld

Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind

Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap

He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn't stand here long

He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep
Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around

The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside

Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull

The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart

Passengers were flying
Backward, forward, far and fast
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last
The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done

The watchman lay there dreaming
At forty-five degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees

Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside

Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?

His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene

The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere

Alarm-bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side

Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers

The rich man, Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
Be the last trip of his life

Calvin, Blake, and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale or disembark

Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance

They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks

The bishop left his cabin
To help all those in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said, ""The poor are yours to feed""

Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world

Jim Backus smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him

He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace

They battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn't hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold

Leo said to Cleo
I think I'm going mad
But he'd lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had

He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm

Petals fell from flowers
Tell all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on

The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go

There were many, many others
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before

The watchman, he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone

The captain, barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel

He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he lost the race

In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears

When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
The loveliest and the best

They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
For the judgment of God's hand

The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
The love had lost its fires
All things had run their course

The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the deep blue sea"
Temporary Like Achilles,Temporary Like Achilles,Bob Dylan,"Standing on your window, honey
Yes, I’ve been here before
Feeling so harmless
I’m looking at your second door
How come you don’t send me no regards?
Ya' know I want your loving
Honey, why are you so hard?

Kneeling ’neath your ceiling
Yes, I guess I’ll be here for a while
I’m trying to read your portrait, but
I’m helpless, like a rich man’s child
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
You know I want your lovin’
Honey, why you so hard?

Like a poor fool in his prime
Yes, I know you can hear me walk
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime
Or is it just solid rock?

Well, I lean into your hallway
Lean against your velvet door
I watch upon your scorpion
Who crawls across your circus floor
Just what do you think you have to guard?
You know I want your lovin’
Honey, but you’re so hard
Achilles is in your alleyway
He don’t want me here, he does brag
He’s pointing to the sky
And he’s hungry, like a man in drag
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
You know I want your lovin'
Honey, but you’re so hard"
That Lucky Old Sun,That Lucky Old Sun,Bob Dylan,"Up in the mornin', out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll 'round heaven all day
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll 'round heaven all day
Good Lord above, can't you see I'm pining, tears in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise
Show me that river, take me across, and wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do, but roll 'round heaven all day
Oh Lord above can't you know I'm pining, tears in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise
Show me that river, take me across, and wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do, but roll 'round heaven all day"
That Old Black Magic,That Old Black Magic,Bob Dylan,"Hat old black magic has weaved its spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
Same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
And then that elevator starts its ride
And down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in the tide
I should stay away but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame
Aflame with burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire
You're the lover I have waited for
You're the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Baby down and down I go, round and round I go
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame
Aflame with burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire
For you're the lover I have waited for
You're the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Baby down and down I go, round and round I go
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
I'm under that old black magic called love
Oh in a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love

Under that old black magic called love"
That Old Feeling,That Old Feeling,Bob Dylan,"I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight, I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by, I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye, my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
Then I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
'Cause that old feeling is still in my heart
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
'Cause that old feeling is still in my heart"

The 1913 massacre,The 1913 massacre,Bob Dylan,"Paroles de la chanson 1913 Massacre :
Take a trip with me in nineteen thirteen
To Calumet, Michigan in the copper country
I'll take you to a place called Italian Hall
And the miners are having their big Christmas ball
I'll take you in a door and up a high stairs
Singing and dancing is heard ev'rywhere
I'll let you shake hands with the people you see
And watch the kids dance 'round the big Christmas tree
There's talking and laughing and songs in the air
And the spirit of Christmas is there ev'rywhere
Before you know it you're friends with us all
And you're dancing around and around in the hall
You ask about work and you ask about pay
They'll tell you they make less than a dollar a day
Working their copper claims, risking their lives
So it's fun to spend Christmas with children and wives
A little girl sits down by the Christmas tree lights
To play the piano so you gotta keep quiet
To hear all this fun; you would not realize
That the copper boss thug men are milling outside
The copper boss thugs stuck their heads in the door
One of them yelled and he screamed, ""There's a fire""
A lady she hollered, ""There's no such a thing;
Keep on with your party, there's no such a thing.""
A few people rushed and there's only a few
""It's just the thugs and the scabs fooling you.""
A man grabbed his daughter and he carried her down
But the thugs held the door and he could not get out
And then others followed, about a hundred or more
But most everybody remained on the floor
The gun thugs, they laughed at their murderous joke
And the children were smothered on the stairs by the
Door
Such a terrible sight I never did see
We carried our children back up to their tree
The scabs outside still laughed at their spree
And the children that died there was seventy-three
The piano played a slow funeral tune
And the town was lit up by a cold Christmas moon
The parents, they cried and the men, they moaned
""See what your greed for money has done?"""
The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest,The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest,Bob Dylan,"Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest
They were the best of friends
So when Frankie Lee needed money one day
Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
And placed them on a footstool
Just above the plotted plain
Sayin', “Take your pick, Frankie Boy
My loss will be your gain”

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down
And put his fingers to his chin
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him
His head began to spin
“Could ya please not stare at me like that?,” he said
“It’s just my foolish pride
But sometimes a man must be alone
And this is no place to hide”

Well, Judas, he just winked and said
“Alright, I’ll leave you here
But you’d better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want
Before they all disappear”
“I’m gonna start my pickin' right now
Just tell me where you’ll be”
Judas pointed down the road
And said, “Eternity!”
“Eternity?” said Frankie Lee
With a voice as cold as ice
“That’s right,” said Judas, “Eternity
Though you might call it ‘Paradise’”
“I don’t call it anything”
Said Frankie Lee with a smile
“All right,” said Judas Priest
“I’ll see you after a while”

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down
Feeling low and mean
When just then a passin' stranger
Burst upon the scene
Saying, “Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler
Whose father's deceased?
Well, if you are, there’s a fellow callin' you down the road
And they say his name is Priest”

“Oh, yes, he is my friend”
Said Frankie Lee in fright
“I do recall him very well
In fact, he just left my sight”
“Yes, that’s the one,” said the stranger
As quiet as a mouse
“Well, my message is, he’s down the road
Stranded in a house”
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked
He dropped everything and ran
Until he came up to the spot
Where Judas Priest did stand
“What kind of house is this,” he said
“Where I have come to roam?”
“It’s not a house,” says Judas Priest
“It’s not a house, it’s a home”

Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled
He soon lost all control
Over ev’rything which he had made
While the mission bells did toll
He just stood there staring
At that big house as bright as any sun
With four and twenty windows
And a woman’s face in ev’ry one

Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee
With a soulful, bounding leap
And, foaming at the mouth
He began to make his midnight creep
For sixteen nights and days he raved
But on the seventeenth he burst
Into the arms of Judas Priest
Which is where he died of thirst
No one tried to say a thing
When they carried him out in jest
Except, of course, the little neighbor boy
Who carried him to rest
And he just walked along, alone
With his guilt so well concealed
And muttered underneath his breath
“Nothing is revealed”

Well, the moral of this story
The moral of this song
Is simply that one should never be
Where one does not belong
So when you see your neighbor carrying somethin'
Help him with his load
And don’t go mistaking Paradise
For that home across the road"
The Ballad of Ira Hayes,The Ballad of Ira Hayes,Bob Dylan,"Gather round you people and a story I will tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona land
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Till their white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed
Now Ira's folks were hungry and their farms when crops of weeds
But when war came he volunteers and forgot, the white man's greed
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

They started up Iwo Jima Hill, 250 men
But only 27 lived to walk back down that hill again
And when the fight was over and the old glory raised
One of the men who held it high was the Indian Ira Hayes
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

Now Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand
But he was just a Pima Indian, no money crops, no chance
And at home nobody cared what Ira had done and the wind did the Indian's dance
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone
He died drunk early one morning, alone in the land he had fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore

The Beaten Path (Introduction),The Beaten Path (Introduction),Bob Dylan,"In 1974 I played the first of many shows with the Band—maybe in eight years. We were in a hockey arena in Chicago. There were maybe 18,000 people there. The Band and I hadn’t played publicly together since 1966 where our shows caused a lot of disruption and turmoil—a lot of anger. Now we were in Chicago starting up again. There was no way to predict what was going to happen. At the end of the concert we had played over 25 or 30 songs and we were standing on the stage looking out. The audience was in semi-darkness. All of a sudden, somebody lit a match. And then somebody else lit another match. In short time, there were areas of the arena that were engulfed in matches. Within seconds after that, it looked like the whole arena was in flames and that all the people in the arena had struck matches and were going to burn the place down. The Band and I looked for the nearest stage exit as none of us wanted to go down in flames. It seemed like nothing had changed. If we thought the response was extreme on the earlier tours we played, this was positively apocalyptic. Every one of us on the stage thought that we’d really done it this time—that the fans were going to burn the arena down. Obviously we were wrong. We misinterpreted and misunderstood the reaction of the crowd. What we believed to be disapproval was actually a grand appreciative gesture. Appearances can be deceiving.
For this series of paintings, the idea was to create pictures that would not be misinterpreted or misunderstood by me or anybody else. When the Halcyon Gallery brought the idea of me doing American landscapes for an exhibition, all they had to do was say it once. And after a bit of clarification, I took it to heart and ran with it. The common theme of these works having something to do with the American landscape—how you see it while crisscrossing the land and seeing it for what it’s worth. Staying out of the mainstream and traveling the back roads, free-born style. I believe that the key to the future is in the remnants of the past. That you have to master the idioms of your own time before you can have any identity in the present tense. Your past begins the day you were born and to disregard it is cheating yourself of who you really are.
My idea was to keep things simple, only deal with what is externally visible. These paintings are up to the moment realism—archaic, most static, but quivering in appearance. They contradict the modern world. However, that’s my doing. The San Francisco Chinatown street stands merely two blocks away from corporate, windowless buildings. But these cold giant structures have no meaning for me in the world that I see or choose to see or be a part of or gain entrance to. If you look half a block away from the Coney Island hot-dog stand, the sky is littered with high rises. I choose not to see them either. Down the road, across the highway from the Cabin in the Woods is a manicured golf course. But it has little meaning compared to the seemingly worthless shack which speaks to me. The Alabama Side Show is surrounded by woods in all directions. The side show happens to be in a clearing and you go there by dirt road. I chose to paint the side show instead of the endless woods. There are countless other works where this is also true.
All the iconography is used in a semi-conscious way. I chose images because of the meanings they have for me, and patterns can be seen in the repeating images—roads, shacks, piers, automobiles, streets, bayous, railroad tracks, bridges, motels, truck stops, power lines, farmyards, theater marquees, churches, signs and symbols, etc.—all establishing a certain type of compositional value. I would say the purpose is plain, non-experimental or exploratory.
Some of these works have much complexity of detail. Some are less demanding . . . in some cases my hand couldn’t do what my eye was perceiving. So I went to the camera-obscura method. The camera obscura was a primitive camera invented in the 1600s which projected an image upside down so the painter could work from it. This was a real camera, but the image was not printable. It could only be seen and filled in. Caravaggio used this in about all of his paintings and so did Van Eyck and Vermeer. These days you don’t have to go to all that trouble. You can use a real camera. I put a 58-mm 0.43x wide-angle conversion lens onto a used Nikon D3300 Af-p on quite a few paintings, Downtown Bank, Katz’s, Nathans, Russ & Daughters, Roy’s, Blue Line, among others, and was able to get the desired effect. If that didn’t work, I used a convex Plexiglass RCA 24 x 20 television screen that can be found in old junk shops and looked at the world through that. On Curry Road in Arizona, I used an old movie frame, and I did that on a couple of different paintings, too. In just as many others I drew it straight on. Topanga Ranch, Ice Cream Factory, Truck Stops, Flat Top Mt. Diner, and Del Rio Cantina. The method with the particular altered lens was used for fullness of effect. In a lot of the other cases, all I needed was a straight edge, compass, and a T square going on a case-by-case basis without abandoning tradition or adhering to any conventions or aesthetic doctrines.
The watercolors and acrylics done here purposely show little or no emotion, yet I would say they are not necessarily emotionally stringent. The attempt was made to represent reality and images as they are without idealizing them. My idea is to compose works that create stability, working with generalized, universal, and easily identifiable objects. Throughout, there is the attempt to depict scenes of life and inanimate life for their own sake (Ice Cream Shack, Arcade, Threatening Skies). Da Vinci paints a blurred picture—you see no lines but clouds that fade into one another with different color schemes. An opposing view would be Mondrian and Van Gogh with strict lines that define the volumes of space. In the middle somewhere would be Kandinsky and Rouault. And these paintings would probably fall into that category.
An attempt was made to depersonalize the works—strip them of illusion. All the work is exclusively placed in non-exotic settings within a rationally defined space. The focus points are important and sometimes unusually placed. Background and foreground not easily defined. In Amusement Park Alleyway, the focus point is the Ferris wheel in the background. The orange Chevy truck might be centered in the foreground but it’s not the focal point. In Morning in Pittsburgh, the focal point would be the bridge in the background instead of the larger warehouse in the foreground. Just like in the Flat Top Diner, the focal point might actually be the green trees.
I tried to create the two dimensional image using a mathematical system. At times, the background and foreground converge. Natural scenery is always the main feature. These are not crowded compositions. They are using basic structures to express feelings and ideas. Perfect proportion and logic instead of emotion. The nature of beauty, the lines, forms, shape, and texture that emphasize the recognizable create harmony where natural scenery is the main feature.
I restricted myself to traditional subject matter, viewing nothing as shallow or gaudy. A simple hot-dog stand can have classical features, and I view it as such (Donut Shop, High Wire). Whiplash curves, flying buttresses, pointed steeples, arches, and waves. They are all there, reflecting any time period, purposely trying to stay away from dramatic or theatrical lighting effects, bringing naturalism to the forefront.
In some paintings, the brightness of reflected light was brought forth in evident brushstrokes. Sometimes sunlight hitting certain places would contrast deeply with areas of shadow (Sunset on the Prairie, Threatening Skies). I tried to avoid skewed perspectives or man-made light, yet sometimes it couldn’t be avoided. An expert painter is a master in color theory, which means he can turn white into black using a complex value system of colors and hues like a Mark Rothko. “The Beaten Path” however, reflects explorations in color, sometimes using colors that become less pronounced and outlines that become less precise. Other times tipping toward the monochromatic (Oil Rigger’s Shack, Twilight After Dusk).
Flowing or curved lines form another visual vehicle, suggesting a far distance in a landscape painting. Architecture itself is always a vital source of ideas and inspiration, but, always, “The Beaten Path” tries to return to the traditional methods of perceptions—things that are perceived in the visible world—taking the three dimensional into a two dimensional format using contrast, location, isolation, and convergence.
If there is a soundtrack to this compilation of paintings, I would say it could be recordings by Peetie Wheatstraw in some places, Charlie Parker in others, Clifford Brown or Blind Lemon, maybe Guitar Slim—artists that make us a lot bigger when listening to them. It would have to be that way. Absolutely.
There was a conscious attempt to dismiss consumer culture or popular culture, including mass media, commercial art, celebrities, consumer or product packaging, billboard signs, comic strips, magazine advertising. “The Beaten Path” works represent a different subject matter from the everyday imagery of consumer culture. There is nothing to suggest these paintings were inspired by the writings of Sigmund Freud or that they were based on any mental images that occur in dreams, no fantasy worlds, religious mysticism or ambiguous subject matter. In every picture the viewer doesn’t have to wonder whether it’s an actual object or a delusional one. If the viewer visited where the picture actually existed, he or she would see the same thing. It is what unites us all."
The Best Is Yet to Come,The Best Is Yet to Come,Bob Dylan,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still it's a real good bet the best is yet to come
The best is yet to come and, babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet!
The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine, I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before but, baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here!
The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine"
The Boxer,The Boxer,Bob Dylan,"I'm just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squadered my resistance
For a pocketful of numbles
Such are promises, all lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
And cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains"
The Christmas Blues,The Christmas Blues,Bob Dylan,"The jingle bells are jingling
The streets are white with snow
The happy crowds are mingling
But there's no one that I know
I'm sure that you'll forgive me
If I don't enthuse
I guess I got the Christmas blues

I've done my window shopping
There's not a store I missed
But what's the use of stoppin'
When there's no one on your list
You'll know the way I'm feeling
When you love and you lose
I guess I've got the Christmas blues

When somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Christmas is a joy of joys
But friends, when you're lonely
You'll find that it's only
A thing for little girls and little boys
May all your days be merry
Your seasons full of cheer
But till it's January
I'll just go and disappear

Old Santa may have brought you
Some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me the blues
Those brightly packaged
Tinsel covered Christmas blues

Old Santa may have brought you
Some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me the blues
Those brightly packaged
Tinsel covered Christmas blues"
The Christmas Song,The Christmas Song,Bob Dylan,"All through the year we waited
Waited through spring and fall
To hear silver bells ringing
See winter time bringing
The happiest season of all

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
Merry Christmas to you"

And I look back and I wonder

The Death Of Mett Till,The Death Of Mett Till,Bob Dylan,"Was down in Mississippi not so long ago
When a young boy from Chicago town
Walked in a Southern door
This boy's fateful tragedy
You all should remember well
The color of his skin was black
And his name was Emmett Till
Some men, they dragged him to a barn
And there they beat him up
They said they had a reason
But disremember what
They tortured him and did some things
Too evil to repeat
There were screaming sounds inside the barn
There was laughing sounds out on the street
Then they rolled his body down a gulf
Amidst a blood red rain
And they threw him in the waters wide
To cease his screaming pain
The reason that they killed him there
And I'm a-sure, it ain't no lie
'Cause he was born in black-skin barn
He was born to die
And then to stop the United States
Of yelling for a trial
Two brothers, they confessed
That they had killed poor Emmett Till
But on the jury there were men
Who had helped the brothers commit this awful crime
And so this trial was a mockery
But nobody there seemed to mind
I saw the morning papers
But I could not bear
To see smiling brothers
Walkin' down the courthouse stairs
For the jury found them innocent
And the brothers, they went free
While Emmett's body floats the foam
Of a Jim Crow southern sea
If you can't speak out against this kind of thing
A crime that's so unjust
Your eyes are filled with dead men's clay
Your ears must be filled with dust
Your arms and legs
They must be in shackles and chains
And your mind, it must cease to flow
For you to let our human race
Fall down so God-awful low
This song is just a reminder
To remind your fellow man
That this kind of thing still lives today
In that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan
But if all of us folks that thinks alike
If we gave all we could give
We could make this great land of ours
A greater place to live"

The first Noel, the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel

This by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went

The Groom’s Still Waiting at the Altar,The Groom’s Still Waiting at the Altar,Bob Dylan,"Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild goose chase

West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
About the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be

West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

Don't know what I can say about Claudette that wouldn't come back to haunt me
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she began to want me
But I know God has mercy on them who are slandered and humiliated
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she’d only made me feel obligated
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
I see people who are supposed to know better standing around like furniture
There's a wall between you and what you want and you got to leap it
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to
Keep it

West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

Cities on fire, phones out of order
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border
What can I say about Claudette?
Ain't seen her since January
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page

The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,Bob Dylan,"William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gatherin'
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears
William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was a-snarling
And in a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn’t even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothin' to William Zanzinger
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears
In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all’s equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain’t pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught ’em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Bury the rag deep in your face
For now’s the time for your tears"
The Love That Faded,The Love That Faded,Bob Dylan,"The love that faded left me only tears
Days that were happy turned into lonely years
Vows that we made turned into lies
My life is empty, my lonely heart cries
I tried to forget that we'll never be
Nothing left for me but dust in the breeze
My way is lonely but I think I'm lost
My love was wasted, I'm paying the cost
Brown eyes, blue eyes they're all the same
None are for me, I've lost their game
Tomorrow has nothing but worries and cares

Now my lonely heart must break and pay
Nothing now but heartaches through years
The love that faded left me only tears"

I think to myself I might not take it anymore
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me

But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near
Sets my heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears

The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein’ seen
But that’s just because he doesn’t want to turn into some machine
Took a woman like you
To get through to the man in me"

And tore up the tracks again

By May the 10th, Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so well
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, ""Na, na, la, na, na, la""
Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
""Virgil, quick, come see
There goes Robert E. Lee!""
Now, I don't mind chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
You take what you need
And you leave the rest
But they should never
Have taken the very best

And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went, ""Na, na, la, na, na, la""

I will work the land
And like my brother above me
Who took a rebel stand
He was just 18, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave

But a cloud drifted over its face
You kissed me and went on your way
The night we called it a day
I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament in my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day
Soft through the dark
The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer than he was I
The moon went down, stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day
Soft through the dark
The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song

Now, how in the world do you get to Heaven
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
I just spent sixty days in the jailhouse
For the crime of having no dough
Now here I am back out on the street
For the crime of having nowhere to go
Save your neck or save your brother
Looks like it's one or the other
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
Now two young kids might start a ruckus
You know they feel you trying to shuck us
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in"
The Sound of Silence,The Sound of Silence (Ft. Paul Simon),Bob Dylan,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walk alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
""Fools"" said I,""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the signs said, 'The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence"
The Times They Are A-Changin’,The Times They Are A-Changin',Bob Dylan,"Come gather 'round people, wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times, they are a-changin'
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
For the times, they are a-changin'"

The Usual,The Usual,Bob Dylan,"I'm trippin' over dumb drunks at a party
Girlfriend just ran off with the DJ
I give her everything, but she refused it
It doesn't matter, she don't know how to use it
My confidence is dwindling
Look at the shape I'm in
Where's my pearls, where's my swine?
I'm not thirsty, but I'm standing in line
I'll have the usual
I'll have the usual
Fifty silhouettes bumpin' on the dance floor
Pink elephants fallin' through a trap door
Sixty cigarettes a day 'cause I'm nervous
When will that bitch serve us?
I used to be a good boy, livin' the good life
Fifty thousand kisses later she was a housewife
She was good, I was unkind
I'm not thirsty, but I'm standin' in line
I'll have the usual
I'll have the usual
(On the rocks)
(Two ice cubes)
(And a little umbrella)
Big Jim says the second comin's comin'
I think he's just seein' double or something
Or something
You can hang around waiting for the also rans
I can't win, but I've seen enough, man
A fifth of whiskey he could knock it away
I drink some more and it's judgment day
I had a future, but she just passed out
I'm gonna drink until I see what it is I wanna think about
I'll have the usual
I'll have the usual
I'll have the usual
On the rocks
With a twist"
The Water Is Wide,The Water Is Wide,Bob Dylan,"The water is wide and I can't cross over
Neither have I wings that I could fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I

There is a ship and it sails on the sea
Loaded deep as deep can be
But not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not if I sink or swim

I leaned my back up against an oak
Thinking it was a trusty tree
But first it bent and then it broke
Just like my own false love to me

Oh love is gentle, love is kind
Gay as a jewel when first it's new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like some morning dew"
The Weight,The Weight,Bob Dylan,"I pulled into Nazareth, was feeling about half past dead;
I just need some place where I can lay my head
""Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?""
He just grinned and shook my hand, and ""No!"", was all he said

Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free;
Take a load off Fanny, And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me

I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide;
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said, ""Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown.""
She said, ""I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around.""


Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day
""Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?""
He said, ""Do me a favor, son, woncha stay and keep Anna Lee company?""

Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog
He said, ""I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog.""
I said, ""Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man.""
He said, ""That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can.""


Catch a cannon ball now, t'take me down the line
My bag is sinking' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone"
The Wicked Messenger,The Wicked Messenger,Bob Dylan,"There was a wicked messenger
From Eli he did come
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter
When questioned who had sent for him
He answered with his thumb
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter

He stayed behind the assembly hall
It was there he made his bed
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand which read
“The soles of my feet, I swear they’re burning”

Oh, the leaves began to falling
And the seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many
And he was told but these few words
Which opened up his heart
“If ye cannot bring good news, then don’t bring any”"
There’s a Flaw in My Flue,There’s a Flaw in My Flue,Bob Dylan,"I used to sit by my fireplace
And dream about you
But now that won't do
There's a flaw in my flue
Your lovely face in my fireplace
Was all that I saw
But now it won't draw
My flue has a flaw
From every beautiful ember a memory arose
Now I try to remember and smoke gets in my nose
It's not as sweet as the unit-heat
To dream about you
So darling, adieu
There's a flaw in my flue"
These Foolish Things,These Foolish Things,Bob Dylan,"A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fairground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone line rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you"
These Hands,These Hands,Bob Dylan,"These hands aren't the hands of a gentleman
These hands are calloused and old
But these hands?raised?a family
These hands?built a home
Now these hands raise?to pray the Lord
These hands won the heart of my?loved?one
And?with hers they?were never alone
If?these hands filled their task
Then what more can one ask?
For these fingers have worked to the bone
Now don't try to judge me by what you'd like to be
For my life ain't been much success
While some people have power, but still they grieve
While these hands brought me happiness
Now I'm tired and I'm old and I ain't got much gold
Maybe things ain't been all that I planned
But Lord above, hear my plea, when it's time to take me
Take a look at these hard-workin' hands"
They Killed Him,They Killed Him,Bob Dylan,"There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi
He would not bow down he would not fight
He knew the deal was down and dirty
And nothing wrong could make it right away
But he knew his duty and the prize he had to pay
Just another holy man who tried to be a friend
My God, they killed him

Another man from Atlanta, Georgia
By name of Martin Luther King
He shook the land like the rolling thunder
And made the bells of freedom ring today
With a dream of beauty that they could not burn away
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand
My God, they killed him

The only Son of God Almighty
The holy one called Jesus Christ
He healed the lame and fed the hungry
And for his love they took his life away
On the road to glory where the story never ends
Just the holy Son of Man we'll never understand
My God, they killed him
There was a man named Mahatma Gandi
A man named Martin Luther King
The only Son of God Almighty
The only one called Jesus Christ
On the road to glory where the story never ends
Just the holy Son of Man we'll never understand
My God, they killed him

There was a man named Mahatma Gandi

Things Have Changed,Things Have Changed,Bob Dylan,"A worried man with a worried mind
No one in front of me and nothing behind
There’s a woman on my lap and she’s drinking champagne
Got white skin, got assassin’s eyes
I’m looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies
I’m well dressed, waiting on the last train
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now I’m expecting all hell to break loose

People are crazy and times are strange
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
I used to care, but things have changed

This place ain’t doing me any good
I’m in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag
Ain’t no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think he’s got anything to prove
Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too
Don’t get up gentlemen, I’m only passing through

People are crazy and times are strange
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
I used to care, but things have changed
I’ve been walking forty miles of bad road
If the Bible is right, the world will explode
I’ve been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You can’t win with a losing hand
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street

People are crazy and times are strange
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
I used to care, but things have changed

I hurt easy, I just don’t show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get low down, gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
I’m in love with a woman who don’t even appeal to me
Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake
I’m not that eager to make a mistake

People are crazy and times are strange
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
I used to care, but things have changed"
Things We Said Today,Things We Said Today,Bob Dylan,"You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinkin' of me
Somehow I?will?know
Someday when I'm?lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then?I will remember
Things we said today

You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay. And that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today"
Thirsty Boots,Thirsty Boots,Bob Dylan,"You've long been on the open road
You've been sleepin in the rain
From the dirt of words and mud of cell
Your clothes are smeared and stained
But the dirty words and muddy cells
Will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself
Till you are off again
So take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
I'm just lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes
But tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plain from field to town
Marching to be free
And of the rusted prison gates
That tumbled by degree
Like laughing children one by one
Who looked like you and me
Take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
I'm just lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes
I know you are no stranger down
The crooked rainbow trails
From dancing cliff-edged shattered sills
Of slender shackled jails
But the voices drift up from below
As the walls are being scaled
All of this and more my friend
Your song shall not be failed
Then take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
I'm just lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes"
This Dream of You,This Dream of You,Bob Dylan,"How long can I stay in this nowhere café
Before night turns into day
I wonder why I'm so frightened of dawn
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on

There's a moment when all old things
Become new again
But that moment might have come and gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on

I look away, but I keep seeing it
I don't want to believe, but I keep believing it
Shadows dance upon the wall
Shadows that seem to know it all

Am I too blind to see, is my heart playing tricks on me
I'm lost in the crowd
All my tears are gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on
Everything I touch seems to disappear
Everywhere I turn you are always here
I'll run this race until my earthly death
I'll defend this place with my dying breath

From a cheerless room in a curtained gloom
I saw a star from heaven fall
I turned and looked again but it was gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on"
This Evening So Soon,This Evening So Soon,Bob Dylan,"Remember this?
Remember Bob Gibson?
Tell old Bill, when he comes home this morning
Tell old Bill, when he comes home this evening
Tell old Bill, when he comes home
To leave them down-town girls alone
This morning, this evening, so soon
Old Sal was baking bread this morning
Old Sal was baking bread this evening
Old Sal was baking bread
When she found out that her Bill was dead
This morning, this evening, so soon
She said “Oh no, it can’t be so”, this morning
“Oh no, it can’t be so”, this evening
She said “Oh no, it can’t be so
My Bill left home about an hour ago”
This morning, this evening, so soon
Well they brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this morning
They brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this evening

This Land Is Your Land,This Land Is Your Land,Bob Dylan,"As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me
I've roamed and rambled, and I've followed my footsteps
To the sunny bright sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me a voice came singing
Singing this land was made for you and me
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me
It was early one morning as I was strolling
The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
As the fog was lifting a voice come chanting
This land was made for you and me
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me
Nobody living can ever stop me
As I go walkin' my freedom highway
Nobody living can make me turn back
This land was made for you and me
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me"
This Nearly Was Mine,This Nearly Was Mine,Bob Dylan,"One dream in my heart, one love to be living for
One love to be living for, this nearly was mine
One girl for my dream, one partner in paradise
This promise of paradise, this nearly was mine
Close to my heart she came, only to fly away
Only to fly as day flies from moonlight
Now, now I'm alone, still dreaming of paradise
Still saying that paradise once nearly was mine"

Three Angels,Three Angels,Bob Dylan,"Three angels up above the street
Each one playing a horn
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out
They’ve been there since Christmas morn
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash
Then a lady in a bright orange dress
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels
The Tenth Avenue bus going west
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around
A man with a badge skips by
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work
Nobody stops to ask why
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Where the angels stand high on their poles
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
In this concrete world full of souls
The angels play on their horns all day
The whole earth in progression seems to pass by
But does anyone hear the music they play
Does anyone even try?"
Thunder on the Mountain,Thunder on the Mountain,Bob Dylan,"Thunder on the mountain, fires on the moon
There's a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
Today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow
Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go
I was thinking' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying
When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line
I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be
I have been looking for her even clear through Tennessee
Feel like my soul is beginning to expand
Look into my heart and you will sort of understand
You brought me here, now you're trying to run me away
The writing's on the wall, come read it, come see what it say
Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum
Gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from
I don't need any guide, I already know the way
Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day
The pistols are poppin' and the power is down
I'd like to try something' but I'm so far from town
The sun keeps shining'
And the North Wind keeps picking up speed
Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need
I've been sitting down studying the art of love
I think it will fit me like a glove
I want some real good woman to do just what I say
Everybody got to wonder
What's the matter with this cruel world today
Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king
I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing
Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches
I'll recruit my army from the orphanages
I been to St. Herman's church and I've said my religious vows
I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows
I got the porkchops, she got the pie
She ain't no angel and neither am I
Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams
Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
Mean old twister bearing down on me
All the ladies of Washington scrambling to get out of town
Looks like something bad gonna happen
Better roll your airplane down
Everybody's going and I want to go too
Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
I did all I could and I did it right there and then
I've already confessed – no need to confess again
Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth
The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf
For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself

Tight Connection To My Heart,Tight Connection To My Heart,Bob Dylan,"Well, I had to move fast
And I couldn't with you around my neck
I said I'd send for you and I did
What did you expect?
My hands are sweating
And we haven't even started yet
I'll go along with the charade
Until I can think my way out
I know it was all a big joke
Whatever it was about
Someday maybe
I'll remember to forget
I'm gonna get my coat
I feel the breath of a storm
There's something I've got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm

Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
I don't know

You're the one I've been looking for
You're the one that's got the key
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you
Or you're too good for me
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
I don't know
Has anybody seen my love?
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight
And there's no moon
There's just a hot-blooded singer
Singing ""Memphis in June,""
While they're beatin' the devil out of a guy
Who's wearing a powder-blue wig
Later he'll be shot
For resisting arrest
I can still hear his voice crying
In the wilderness
What looks large from a distance
Close up ain't never that big
Never could learn to drink that blood
And call it wine
Never could learn to hold you, love
And call you mine"

Has anybody seen my love?
Well, they’re not showing any lights tonight
And there’s no moon
There’s just a hot-blooded singer
Singing “Memphis in June”
While they’re beating the devil out of a guy
Who’s wearing a powder-blue wig
Later he’ll be shot
For resisting arrest
I can still hear his voice crying
In the wilderness
What looks large from a distance
Close up is never that big

Never could learn to drink that blood
And call it wine
Never could learn to hold you, love
And call you mine"
Til I Fell in Love with You,Til I Fell in Love with You,Bob Dylan,"Well, my nerves are exploding and my body’s tense
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence
I’ve been hit too hard, I’ve seen too much
Nothing can heal me now, but your touch
I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’till I fell in love with you

Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky
I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by
Now I feel like I’m coming to the end of my way
But I know God is my shield and he won’t lead me astray
Still I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’till I fell in love with you

Boys in the street beginning to play
Girls like birds flying away
When I’m gone you will remember my name
I’m gonna win my way to wealth and fame
I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’till I fell in love with you

Junk is piling up, taking up space
My eyes feel like they’re falling off my face
Sweat falling down, I’m staring at the floor
I’m thinking about that girl who won’t be back no more
I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’till I fell in love with you
Well, I’m tired of talking, I’m tired of trying to explain
My attempts to please you were all in vain
Tomorrow night before the sun goes down
If I’m still among the living, I’ll be Dixie bound
I just don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’till I fell in love with you"
Time Passes Slowly,Time Passes Slowly,Bob Dylan,"Time passes slowly up here in the mountains
We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream
Time passes slowly when you’re lost in a dream

Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking
Stared out the window to the stars high above
Time passes slowly when you’re searching for love

Ain’t no reason to go in a wagon to town
Ain’t no reason to go to the fair
Ain’t no reason to go up, ain’t no reason to go down
Ain’t no reason to go anywhere

Time passes slowly up here in the daylight
We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Time passes slowly and fades away"
Tin Angel,Tin Angel,Bob Dylan,"It was late last night when the boss came home
To a deserted mansion and a desolate throne
Servant said: “Boss, the lady’s gone
She left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”

“You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man
Come to the point as straight as you can”
“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan
Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand”

The boss he lay back flat on his bed
He cursed the heat and he clutched his head
He pondered the future of his fate
To wait another day would be far too late

“Go fetch me my coat and my tie
And the cheapest labour that money can buy
Saddle me up my buckskin mare
If you see me go by, put up a prayer” (The Boss)

Well, they rode all night, and they rode all day
Eastward, long down the broad highway
His spirit was tired and his vision was bent
His men deserted him and onward he went
He came to a place where the light was dull
His forehead pounding in his skull
Heavy heart was racked with pain
Insomnia raging in his brain

Well, he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword
He renounced his faith, he denied his lord
Crawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall
One way or another put an end to it all

He leaned down, cut the electric wire
Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire
Peered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two
It was hard to tell for certain who was who

He lowered himself down on a golden chain
His nerves were quaking in every vein
His knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air
He ran his fingers through his greasy hair

They looked at each other and their glasses clinked
One single unit, inseparably linked
“Got a strange premonition there’s a man close by” (Henry Lee)
“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly” (The Wife)
From behind the curtain, the boss he crossed the floor
He moved his feet and he bolted the door
Shadows hiding the lines in his face
With all the nobility of an ancient race

She turned, she was startled with a look of surprise
With a hatred that could hit the skies
“You’re a reckless fool, I could see it in your eyes
To come this way was by no means wise” (The Wife)

“Get up, stand up, you greedy-lipped wench
And cover your face or suffer the consequence
You are making my heart feel sick
Put your clothes back on, double-quick” (The Boss)

“Silly boy, you think me a saint
I’ll listen no more to your words of complaint
You’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies
Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes” (The Wife)

“I’d have given you the stars and the planets, too
But what good would these things do you?
Bow the heart if not the knee
Or never again this world you’ll see” (The Boss)
“Oh, please let not your heart be cold
This man is dearer to me than gold” (The Wife)
“Oh, my dear, you must be blind
He’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind” (The Boss)

“You’ve had your way too long with me
Now it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be” (The Wife)
“Try to escape,” he cussed and cursed
‘You’ll have to try to get past me first” (The Boss)

“Do not let your passion rule
You think my heart the heart of a fool
And you, sir, you can not deny
You made a monkey of me, what and for why?” (The Boss)

“I’ll have no more of this insulting chat
The devil can have you, I’ll see to that
Look sharp or step aside
Or in the cradle you’ll wish you’d died” (Henry Lee)

The gun went boom and the shot rang clear
First bullet grazed his ear
Second ball went right straight in
And he bent in the middle like a twisted pin

He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head
He gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed
It would take more than needle and thread
Bleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead

“You shot my husband down, you fiend” (The Wife)
“Husband? What husband? What the hell do you mean?
He was a man of strife, a man of sin
I cut him down and threw him to the wind” (Henry Lee)

This she said with angry breath
“You too shall meet the lord of death
It was I who brought your soul to life” (The Wife)
Then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife

His face was hard and caked with sweat
His arms ached and his hands were wet
“You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife
If you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife” (Henry Lee)

“We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot
But we’re no way similar in body or thought
All husbands are good men, as all wives know” (The Wife)
Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow

His knees went limp and he reached for the door
His tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor
He whispered in her ear: “This is all your fault
My fighting days have come to a halt” (Henry Lee)

She touched his lips and kissed his cheek
He tried to speak but his breath was weak
“You died for me, now I’ll die for you” (The Wife)
She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through

All three lovers together in a heap
Thrown into the grave, forever to sleep
Funeral torches blazed away
Through the towns and the villages all night and all day"
To Be Alone with You,To Be Alone with You,Bob Dylan,"Is it rolling, Bob?

To be alone with you
Just you and me
Now won’t you tell me true
Ain’t that the way it oughta be?
To hold each other tight
The whole night through
Everything is always right
When I’m alone with you

To be alone with you
At the close of the day
With only you in view
While evening slips away
It only goes to show
That while life’s pleasures be few
The only one I know
Is when I’m alone with you

They say that nighttime is the right time
To be with the one you love
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day
But you’re always what I’m thinkin' of
I wish the night were here
Bringin' me all of your charms
When only you are near
To hold me in your arms
I’ll always thank the Lord
When my workin' day is through
I get my sweet reward
To be alone with you"
To Fall in Love with You,To Fall in Love with You,Bob Dylan,"A tear goes down my day is real
But your drying eye upon the shame
Each needs a road for me from you
What paradise? what can I do?
That die for my and the day is dark
I can’t believe for your touch
What I could find oh time is right
If I fell in love to fall in love
To fall in love with you
The day is dark, our time is right
Day in the night deep in the night
I can’t yet be back I heard my- surprise
I see it in your lips I knew it in your eyes
Well I feel your love and I feel no shame
I can’t unleash your horde I call your name
What you’re to me what can I do?
To fall in love to fall in love
To fall in love with you
It just rolls upon the sand
Ever this for now I’m made a man
Can make you see what I can find
I know it in my days ah in my daily mind
Oh will ages roll will ages fly?
I hear your name where angels lie
What do I know? for to come it’s true
To fall in love To fall in love
To fall in love with you
How can the doors trust on a nail?
How can I be surprised of most every day?
In the distant road I can’t be the same
I feel no love I feel no shame
I can’t watch the bay out on my own
We’ve a destined man I can attest it all
I didn’t I could find where I could go
To fall in love to fall in love
To fall in love with you"
To Ramona,To Ramona,Bob Dylan,"Ramona
Come closer
Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness
Will pass as your senses will rise
Oh the flowers of the city
Though breath-like
Get death-like at times
And there’s no use in trying
To deal with the dying
Though I cannot explain that in lines

Your cracked country lips
I still wish to kiss
As to be by the strength of your skin
Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes I’m in
But it grieves my heart, love
To see you trying to be a part of
A world that just don’t exist
It’s all just a dream, babe
A vacuum, a scheme, babe
That sucks you into feelin' like this
I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
With the worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn
Between staying and returning
Back to the South
You’ve been fooled into thinking
That the finishing end is at hand
Yet there’s no one to beat you
No one to defeat you
'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad

I’ve heard you say many times
That you’re better than no one
And no one is better than you
If you really believe that
You know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose
From fixtures and forces and friends
Your sorrow does stem
That hype you and type you
Making you feel
That you gotta' be just like them

I’d forever talk to you
But soon my words
Would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart
I know there's no help I can bring
Everything passes
Everything changes
Just do what you think you should do
And someday maybe
Who knows, baby
I’ll come and be crying to you"
Tombstone Blues,Tombstone Blues,Bob Dylan,"The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
The city fathers they’re trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere’s horse
But the town has no need to be nervous
The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I am in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, “I’ve just been made”
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
And says, “My advice is to not let the boys in”
Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
“Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it’s not poison”
Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I’m in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero, the commander-in-chief
Saying, “Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?”
The commander-in-chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Saying, ""The sun’s not yellow, it’s chicken""

Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I am in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues
The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle
Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I’m in trouble
With the tombstone blues

The geometry of innocence, flesh on the bone
Causes Galileo’s math book to get thrown
At Delilah who's sitting worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after
Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I am in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college
Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I am in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues"
Tomorrow Is a Long Time,Tomorrow Is a Long Time,Bob Dylan,"If today was not a crooked highway
If tonight was not a crooked trail
If tomorrow wasn’t such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Yes, and only if she was lying by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again....

I can’t see my reflection in the waters
I can’t speak the sounds that show no pain
I can’t hear the echo of my footsteps
Or can’t remember the sound of my own name
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Yes, and only if she was lying by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again...

There’s beauty in that silver, singing river
There’s beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true love’s eyes
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Yes, and only if she was lying by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again..."
Tomorrow Night,Tomorrow Night,Bob Dylan,"Tomorrow night, will you remember what you said to night ?
Tomorrow night, will all the thrill be gone ?
Tomorrow night, will it be just another memory
Or just another song, that's in my heart to linger on ?

Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast
And you willingly surrender to me, my darling will it last ?
Tomorrow night, will you be with me when the moon is bright ?
Tomorrow night, will you say those lovely things you said tonight ?

Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast
And you willingly surrender to me, my darling will it last ?
Tomorrow night, will you be with me when the moon is bright ?
Tomorrow night, will you say those lovely things you said tonight ?"

Throw? my mattress out there too
Draw? my letters in the sand
'cause you got to understand
That tonight I'll be staying here with you
I? could have left this town by noon
By? tonight I'd been to someplace new
But I was feeling a little bit scattered
And? your love was all that mattered
So tonight I'll be staying here with you, get ready
Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you
Is it really any wonder
The? changes we put on each other's heads
You came down on me like rolling thunder
I left my dreams on the riverbed
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowin'
I hear them semis rolling too
If there's a driver on the road
Let him have my load
Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you

Oh, your love comes on so strong
And I've waited all day long
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you

Is it really any wonder
The love that a stranger might receive?
You cast your spell and I went under
I find it so difficult to leave

I can hear that whistle blowin'
I see that stationmaster too
If there's a poor boy on the street
Then let him have my seat

Dark Beauty
Won’t you move over and give me some room?
It’s my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies
Dark Beauty
With that long night’s journey in your eyes

Sweet Goddess
Born of a blinding light and a changing wind
Now, don’t be modest, you know who you are and where you’ve been
Jack the Cowboy went up north
He’s buried in your past
The Lone Wolf went out drinking
That was over pretty fast
Sweet Goddess
Your perfect stranger’s comin’ in at last
Silver Angel
With the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve
I’d be grateful if this golden ring you would receive
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch
Sweet Goddess
It must be time to carve another notch

I’m crestfallen
The world of illusion is at my door
I ain’t a-hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore
The prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight
I’ve gained some recognition but I lost my appetite
Dark Beauty
Meet me at the border late tonight"
Trade Winds,Trade Winds,Bob Dylan,"Down where the trade winds play
Down where you lose the day
We found a new world
Where paradise starts we traded hearts
Way down where the trade winds play
Music was everywhere
Flowers were in her hair
Under an awning of silvery boughs we traded vows
The night that I sailed away
Oh, trade winds, what are vows that lovers make?
Oh, trade winds, are they only made to break?
When it is May again
I’ll sail away again
Though I am returning it won’t be the same
She traded her name
Way down where the trade winds play"
Trail of the Buffalo,Trail of the Buffalo,Bob Dylan,"Come round you old time cowboys, and listen to my song
Please do not grow weary, I will not detain you long
Concerning some young cowboy, who did agree to go
Spend the summer pleasantly on the trail of the buffalo
Well I found myself in Griffin, in the year of '83
When a world-famous drover come a-walkin' up to me
Sayin', ""How d'ya do young cowboy. how'd you like to go
Spend the summer pleasantly on the trail of the buffalo?""
Well me being out of work right then, at this drover I did say
""This a-goin' out on the buffalo range depends upon your pay
But if you pay good wages, transportation to and fro'
Think I might go with you on the hunt of the buffalo.""
""yes I will pay good wages and transportation too
If you'll agree to work for me until the season's through
But if you do get homesick and try to run away
You'll starve to death on the prairie and also lose your pay.""
Well with all this flatterin' talkin', he signed up quite a train
Some ten to twelve in number, some able-bodied men
Our trip it was a pleasant one as we hit the westward road
Until we hit old Boggy Creek in old New Mexico
Well there our pleasures ended and our troubles they begun
A lightin' storm did hit us, made the cattle run
I got all full of stickers from the cactus that did grow
Outlaws watchin' to pick us off from the hills of the buffalo
Well our workin' season ended, but the drover would not pay
He said, ""You went and drunk too much, you're all in debt to me.""
But the cowboys never did hear of such a thing as a bankrupt law
So we left tht drover's bones to bleach on the hills of the buffalo"
Train Of Love,Train Of Love,Bob Dylan,"Train of love's a comin', big black wheels are hummin'
People waitin' at the station, happy hearts are drummin'
Train men tell me maybe, ain't she got my baby
Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
Now stop your whistle blowin' 'cause I've got ways of knowin'
You're bringin' other people's lovers but my own keeps goin'
Train of love deceivin', when she's not gone she's leavin'
Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
Train of love now hasten, sweethearts stand and waitin'
Here and there and everywhere there'll gonna be embracin'
Train men tell me maybe, ain't she got my baby
Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
Train of love's a leavin', leavin' my heart grievin'
But early or late I sit and wait because I'm still believin'
We'll walk away together, though I may wait forever
Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home"
Trouble,Trouble,Bob Dylan,"Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm
You got your rabbit’s foot, you got your good-luck charm
But they can’t help you none when there’s trouble

Trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Nothing but trouble

Trouble in the water, trouble in the air
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you’ll find trouble there
Revolution even ain’t no solution for trouble


Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul
Persecution, execution, governments out of control
You can see the writing on the wall inviting trouble


Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground
You ever feel like you’re never alone even when there’s nobody else around?
Since the beginning of the universe man’s been cursed by trouble

Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble"
True Love Tends to Forget,True Love Tends to Forget,Bob Dylan,"I’m getting weary looking in my baby’s eyes
When she’s near me she’s so hard to recognize
I finally realize there’s no room for regret
True love, true love, true love tends to forget

Hold me, baby be near
You told me that you’d be sincere
Every day of the year’s like playing’ Russian roulette
True love, true love, true love tends to forget

I was lying’ down in the reeds without any oxygen
I saw you in the wilderness among the men
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again
All you got to do is wait and I’ll tell you when

You’re a tearjerker, baby, but I’m under your spell
You’re a hard worker, baby, and I know you well
But this weekend in hell is making me sweat
True love, true love, true love tends to forget

You belong to me, baby, without any doubt
Don’t forsake me, baby, don’t sell me out
Don’t keep me knocking’ about from Mexico to Tibet
True love, true love, true love tends to forget"
Trust Yourself,Trust Yourself,Bob Dylan,"Trust yourself
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to do what’s right and not be second-guessed
Don’t trust me to show you beauty
When beauty may only turn to rust
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself

Trust yourself
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when
Don’t trust me to show you the truth
When the truth may only be ashes and dust
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself

Well, you’re on your own, you always were
In a land of wolves and thieves
Don’t put your hope in ungodly man
Or be a slave to what somebody else believes

Trust yourself
And you won’t be disappointed when vain people let you down
Trust yourself
And look not for answers where no answers can be found
Don’t trust me to show you love
When my love may be only lust
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself"

Tryin’ to Get to Heaven,Tryin' to Get to Heaven,Bob Dylan,"The air is getting hotter
There’s a rumbling in the skies
I’ve been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes
Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn’t haunt me like it did before
I’ve been walking through the middle of nowhere
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door

When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see
You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I’ve been walking that lonesome valley
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin’
Like pendulums swinging on chains
When you think that you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I’m just going down the road feeling bad
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
I’m going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don’t know what “all right” even means
I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary-Jane
Miss Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door

Gonna sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I’ll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems
Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers like they did before
I been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down
Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door"

Didn't have no place to go
Could hear may people, cryin' ""Lord, have mercy""
'Cause You're the only one that we can turn to""
Happened a long time ago
A little town
Way back in Mississippi
In Tupelo
There was women, and there was children
They were screamin' an' cryin'
Cryin', ""Lord, have mercy
You're the only one now, that we can turn to""
Way back down in Mississippi, a little country town
I know ya read about it
'Cause I'll never forget it
The mighty flood in Tupelo, Mississippi
Been years ago
Lord, have mercy
Wasn't that a mighty time?
Tupelo's gone"
Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum,Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum,Bob Dylan,"Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
They’re throwing knives into the tree
Two big bags of dead man’s bones
Got their noses to the grindstones
Living in the Land of Nod
Trustin’ their fate to the Hands of God
They pass by so silently
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Well, they’re going to the country, they’re gonna retire
They’re taking a street car named Desire
Looking in the window at the pecan pie
Lot of things they’d like they would never buy
Neither one gonna turn and run
They’re making a voyage to the sun
“His Master’s voice is calling me”
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee
Tweedle-dee Dee and Tweedle-dee Dum
All that and more and then some
They walk among the stately trees
They know the secrets of the breeze
Tweedle-dee Dum said to Tweedle-dee Dee
“Your presence is obnoxious to me”
They’re like babies sittin’ on a woman’s knee
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Well, the rain beating down on my window pane
I got love for you and it’s all in vain
Brains in the pot, they’re beginning to boil
They’re dripping with garlic and olive oil
Tweedle-dee Dee—he’s on his hands and his knees
Saying, “Throw me somethin’, Mister, please”
“What’s good for you is good for me”
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee
Well, they’re living in a happy harmony
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
They’re one day older and a dollar short
They’ve got a parade permit and a police escort
They’re lying low and they’re makin’ hay
They seem determined to go all the way
They run a brick-and-tile company
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Well a childish dream is a deathless need
And a noble truth is a sacred dream
My pretty baby, she’s lookin’ around
She’s wearin’ a multi-thousand dollar gown
Tweedle-dee Dee is a lowdown, sorry old man
Tweedle-dee Dum, he’ll stab you where you stand
“I’ve had too much of your company,”
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee"
Two Soldiers,Two Soldiers,Bob Dylan,"He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy
His voice was low with pain
""I'll do your bidding, comrade mine
If I ride back again
But if you ride back and I am left
You'll do as much for me
Mother, you know, must hear the news
So write to her tenderly

""She's waiting at home like a patient saint
Her fond face pale with woe
Her heart will be broken when I am gone
I'll see her soon, I know.""
Just then the order came to charge
For an instance hand touched hand
They said, ""Aye,"" and away they rode
That brave and devoted band

Straight was the track to the top of the hill
The rebels they shot and shelled
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
And guarded them as they fell
There soon came a horrible dying yell
From heights that they could not gain
And those whom doom and death had spared
Rode slowly back again
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Was the boy with the curly hair
The tall dark man who rode by his side
Lay dead beside him there
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
The words that her lover had said
Momma, you know, awaits the news
And she'll only know he's dead"
Two Trains Runnin’,Two Trains Runnin',Bob Dylan,"Well there's two trains running
And they're running this way
One leaves at midnight
The other at the break of day
At the break of day
At the break of day
Oh Lordy
I've been troubled, I've been a fool
I've been crazy my whole life
Well, I done fell in love
With another man's wife
With another man's wife
Oh, Lordy
I'm gonna find me a woman
Who shines like a morning star
I'm gonna find me a woman
Ride like a Cadillac car
Ride like a Cadillac car
Ride like a Cadillac car
Oh, lordy
Oh, lordy
Well I'm afraid of everybody
And I can't trust myself
Well, the woman I love has
Put me on top of the shelf
Put me on top of the shelf

U.D. Blues,U.D. Blues,Bob Dylan,"Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doing it again
You better duck down the alleyway
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap,in the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills but you only got ten
Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A. look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't try ""No Doz""
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows
Get sick, get well
Hang around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army, if you fail
Look out kid
You're gonna get hit
But losers, cheaters
Six-time users
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters
Ah get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift
Look out kid
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don't want to be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles"
Ugliest Girl in the World,Ugliest Girl in the World,Bob Dylan,"The woman that I love she got a hook in her nose
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second hand clothes
She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop

You know I love her
Yeah I love her
I'm in love with the Ugliest Girl in the World

If I ever lose her I will go insane
I go half crazy when she calls my name
When she says baby I l-l-love you
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do


The woman that I love she got two flat feet
Her knees knock together walking down the street
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed
She ain't much to look at but like I said

I don't mean to say that she got nothing going
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own
When I get low she sets me on my feet
Got a five inch smile but her breath is sweet


The woman that I love she a got a prizefighter nose
Cauliflower ears and a run in her hose
She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop"
Unbelievable,Unbelievable,Bob Dylan,"It’s unbelievable, it’s strange but true
It’s inconceivable it could happen to you
You go north and you go south
Just like bait in the fish’s mouth
You must be living’ in the shadow of some kind of evil star
It’s unbelievable it would get this far

It’s undeniable what they’d have you to think
It’s indescribable, it can drive you to drink
They said it was the land of milk and honey
Now they say it’s the land of money
Whoever thought they could ever make that stick
It’s unbelievable you can get this rich this quick

Every head is so dignified
Every moon is so sanctified
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you’re with me
All the silver, all the gold
All the sweethearts you can hold
That doesn’t come back with stories untold
Are hanging on a tree

It’s unbelievable like a lead balloon
It’s so impossible to even learn the tune
Kill that beast and feed that swine
Scale that wall and smoke that vine
Feed that horse and saddle up the drum
It’s unbelievable, the day would finally come
Once there was a man who had no eyes
Every lady in the land told him lies
He stood beneath the silver sky and his heart began to bleed
Every brain is civilized
Every nerve is analyzed
Everything is criticized when you are in need

It’s unbelievable, it’s fancy-free
So interchangeable, so delightful to see
Turn your back, wash your hands
There’s always someone who understands
It don’t matter no more what you got to say
It’s unbelievable it would go down this way"
Under Your Spell,Under Your Spell,Bob Dylan,"Something’ about you that I can’t shake
Don’t know how much more of this I can take
Baby, I’m under your spell

I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light
Baby, oh what a story I could tell
It’s been nice seeing you, you read me like a book
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look
Baby, I’ll be at the same hotel

I’d like to help you but I’m in a bit of a jam
I’ll call you tomorrow if there’s phones where I am
Baby, caught between heaven and hell
But I will be back, I will survive
You’ll never get rid of me as long as you’re alive
Baby, can’t you tell

Well it’s four in the morning by the sound of the birds
I’m staring’ at your picture, I’m hearing’ your words
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell
Everywhere you go it’s enough to break hearts
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow
I trusted your baby, you can trust me now

Turn back baby, wipe your eye
Don’t think I’m leaving here without a kiss goodbye
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
I’ll see you later when I’m not so out of my head
Maybe next time I’ll let the dead bury the dead
Baby, what more can I tell?

Well the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed
Pray that I don’t die of thirst
Baby, two feet from the well"
Under the Red Sky,Under the Red Sky,Bob Dylan,"There was a little boy and there was a little girl
And they lived in an alley under the red sky
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
And they lived in an alley under the red sky

There was an old man and he lived in the moon
One summer’s day he came passing by
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
And one day he came passing by

Someday little girl, everything for you is gonna be new
Someday little girl, you’ll have a diamond as big as your shoe

Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie

This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town
This is the blind horse that leads you around
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly
The man in the moon went home and the river went dry"
Union Sundown,Union Sundown,Bob Dylan,"Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore
My flashlight’s from Taiwan
My tablecloth’s from Malaysia
My belt buckle’s from the Amazon
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet
It was put together down in Argentina
By a guy making thirty cents a day

Well, it’s sundown on the union
And what’s made in the U.S.A
Sure was a good idea
Till greed got in the way

Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And the pearls are from Japan
Well, the dog collar’s from India
And the flower pot’s from Pakistan
All the furniture, it says “Made in Brazil”
Where a woman, she slaved for sure
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve
You know, that’s a lot of money to her

Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work
I say, “Why you say that for
When nothing you got is U. S –made?”
They don’t make nothin’ here no more
You know, capitalism is above the law
It say, “It don’t count ’less it sells”
When it costs too much to build it at home
You just build it cheaper someplace else


Well, the job that you used to have
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador
The unions are big business, friend
And they’re going out like a dinosaur
They used to grow food in Kansas
Now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Is going to be against the law

Democracy don’t rule the world
You’d better get that in your head
This world is ruled by violence
But I guess that’s better left unsaid
From Broadway to the Milky Way
That’s a lot of territory indeed
And a man’s going to do what he has to do
When he’s got a hungry mouth to feed"

as if they know something
i don’t know
rocco an’ his brothers
say that some people
are worse hung up than me
i don’t wanna hear it

first of all two people get
together an’ they want their doors
enlarged. second of all, more
people see what’s happenin’ an’
come t’ help with the door
enlargement. the ones that arrive
however have nothin’ more than
“let’s get these doors enlarged”
t’ say t’ the ones who were
there in the first place. it follows then that
the whole thing revolves around
nothing but this door enlargement idea.
third of all, there’s a group now existin’
an’ the only thing that keeps them friends
is that they all want the doors enlarged.
obviously, the doors’re then enlarged
fourth of all,
after this enlargement
the group has t’ find
something else t’ keep
them together or
else the door enlargement
will prove t’ be
embarrassing
on fourteenth street
i meet someone
who i know in front
wants t’ put me
uptight
wants me t’ be on
his level
in all honesty
he wants t’ drag
me down there
i realize gravity
is my only enemy
loneliness has clutched
hands an’ squeezes you
into wrongin’ others
everybody has t’ do things
keep themselves occupied
the workin’ ones
have their minds on
the weekends
victims of the system
pack movie theaters
an’ who an’ of what
sadistic company is he
from that has the right
t’ condemn others as trivial
whose fault
an’ who really is t’ blame
for one man carryin’ a gun
it is impossible that
it’s him
slaves are of no special color
an’ the links of chains
fall into no special order
how good an actor do you have to be
and play God
(in greece, a little old lady
a worker lady
looks at me
rubs her chin
an’ by sign language asks
how come i’m so unshaven
“the sea is very beautiful here”
i reply
pointin’ t’ my chin.
an’ she believes me
needs no other answer
i strum the guitar
she dances
laughs
her bandana flies
i too realize that
she will die here
one the side of this sea
her death is certain here
my death is unknown
an’ i come t’ think that
i love her)
i talk t’ people every day
involved in some scene
good an’ evil are but words
invented by those
that are trapped in scenes
on what grounds are the
grounds for judgment
an i think also
that there is not
one thing anyplace
anywhere that makes any
sense. there are only tears
an’ there is only sorrow
there are no problems
i have seen what i’ve loved
slip away an’ vanish. i still
love what i’ve lost but t’ run
an’ try t’ catch it’d
be very greedy
for the rest of my life
i will never chase a livin’ soul
into the prison grasp
of my own self-love
i can’t believe that i have
t’ hate anybody
an’ when i do
it will only be out of fear
an’ i’ll know it
i know no answers an’ no truth
for absolutely no soul alive
i will listen t’ no one
who tells me morals
there are no morals
an’ i dream a lot
so go joshua
go fit your battle
i have t’ go t’ the woods
for a while
i hope you understand
but if you don’t
it doesn’t matter
i will be with you
nex’ time around
don’t think about me
i’ll be ok
just go ahead out there
right out there
do what you say
you’re gonna do
an’ who knows
someday
someone might even
write
a song
about you"

Up on Cripple Creek,Up on Cripple Creek,Bob Dylan,"When I get off of this mountain, you know where I want to go?
Straight down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles, Louisiana, little Bessie, girl that I once knew
She told me just to come on by, if there's anything she could do
Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor, I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough she had won
Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half
She tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea
Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box
She said, ""I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk""
Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat
Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold
And this living on the road is getting pretty old
So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted to go and see my Bessie again
Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one"
Up to Me,Up to Me,Bob Dylan,"Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing
Now somebody’s got to show their hand, time is an enemy
I know you’re long gone, I guess it must be up to me

If I’d thought about it I never would’ve done it, I guess I would’ve let it slide
If I'd-a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me would’ve died
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me

Now the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom
I’ve only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume
In fourteen months I’ve only smiled once and I didn’t do it consciously
Somebody’s got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me

It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch
I’d just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me

Now I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers’ club
I would’ve followed you in the door, but I didn’t have a ticket stub
So I waited all night ’til the break of day, hoping one of us could get free
When the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
You looked a little burned out my friend, I thought it might be up to me

I met somebody face to face, I had to remove my hat
She’s everything I need and love, but I can’t be swayed by that
It frightens me, the awful truth, of how sweet life can be
But she ain’t goin' to make a move, I guess it must be up to me

Now we heard the Sermon on the Mount, and I knew it was too complex
It didn’t amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty
Somebody’s got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me

Dupree came in pimpin’ tonight to the Thunderbird Café
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way
Now I just can’t rest without you, love, I need your company
You ain’t goin' to cross the line, I guess it must be up to me

There’s a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle
She’s the one you been wondering about, but there’s really nothing much to tell
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history
Somebody’s got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me
So go on boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don’t have all that much time
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain’t my property
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me

If we never meet again, baby, remember me
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me"
Visions of Johanna,Visions of Johanna,Bob Dylan,"Ain’t it just like the night to play tricks when you’re tryin' to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin’ you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there’s nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman’s bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the “D” train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it’s him or them that’s really insane
Louise, she’s all right, she’s just near
She’s delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna’s not here
The ghost of ’lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He’s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I’m in the hall
How can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn
Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, “Jeeze
I can’t find my knees”
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel
The peddler now speaks to the countess who’s pretending to care for him
Sayin’, “Name me someone that’s not a parasite and I’ll go out and say a prayer for him”
But like Louise always says
“Ya can’t look at much, can ya man?”
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes ev’rything’s been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain"

Waitin’ for You,Waitin' for You,Bob Dylan,"I never dreamed there could be
A someone made just for me
And I'm letting her have her way
I'm here to see what she has to say
Ah, the poor girl always wins the day
I'm stayin' ahead of the game
And she's a-doin' the same
And the whiskey flyin' into my head
The fiddler's arm has gone dead
And talk is beginning to spread
When did our love go bad
Whatever happened to the best friend that I had
It's been so long since I held you tight
Been so long since we said good night
The taste of tears is bittersweet
When you're near me my heart forgets to beat
You're there every night among the good and the true
And I'll be 'round waiting for you
Well the king of them all is starting to fall
I lost my gal at the boatman's' ball
The night has a thousand hearts and eyes
Hope may vanish, but it never dies
I'll see you tomorrow when freedom rings
I'm gonna stay on top of things
It's the middle of summer and the moon is blue
And I'll be 'round waiting for you
Well, another deal gone down
Another man done gone
You put up with it all
And you carry on
Something holding you back
But you'll come through
I'd bet the world and everything in it on you
Happiness is but a state of mind
Anytime you want you can cross the state line
You don't need to be rich or well to do
I'll be 'round waiting for you"

She ain’t a-feelin’ well
When she’s better only time will tell


My money comes and goes
My money comes and goes

Walls of Red Wing,Walls of Red Wing,Bob Dylan,"Oh, the age of the inmates
I remember quite freely
No younger than twelve
No older ’n seventeen
Thrown in like bandits
And cast off like criminals
All inside the walls
On the grounds of Red Wing

From the dirty old mess hall
You march to the brick wall
Too weary to talk
And too tired to sing
And it’s all afternoon
You remember your hometown
All inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

Oh, the gates are cast iron
And the walls are barbed wire
Stay far from the fence
With the ’lectricity sting
And it’s keep down your head
And stay in your number
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing
Oh, it’s fare thee well
To the deep hollow dungeon
Farewell to the boardwalk
That takes you to the screen
And farewell to the minutes
They threaten you with it
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing

It’s many a guard
That stands around smiling
Holding his club
Like he was a king
Hoping to get you
Behind the wood piling
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing

The night aimed shadows
Through the crossbar windows
And the wind punched hard
To make the wall-siding sing
It’s many a night
I pretended to be a-sleeping
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing
As the rain rattled heavy
On the bunkhouse shingles
And the sounds of the night
They made my ears ring
Till the keys of the guards
Clicked the tune of the morning
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing

Oh, some of us’ll end up
In St. Cloud Prison
And some of us’ll end up
To be lawyers and things
And some of us’ll stand
To meet you on your crossroads
From inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing"

Watching the River Flow,Watching the River Flow,Bob Dylan,"What’s the matter with me
I don’t have much to say
Daylight sneaking through the window
And I’m still in this all-night café
Walking to and fro beneath the moon
Out to where the trucks are rolling slow
To sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow

Wish I was back in the city
Instead of this old bank of sand
With the sun beating down over the chimney tops
And the one I love so close at hand
If I had wings and I could fly
I know where I would go
But right now I’ll just sit here so contentedly
And watch the river flow

People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah
Makes you stop and all wonder why
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
Who just couldn’t help but cry
Oh, this old river keeps on rolling, though
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And as long as it does I’ll just sit here
And watch the river flow
People disagreeing everywhere you look
Makes you want to stop and read a book
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
That was really shook
But this old river keeps on rolling, though
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And as long as it does I’ll just sit here
And watch the river flow

Watch the river flow
Watching the river flow
Watching the river flow
But I’ll sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow"
Watered-Down Love,Watered-Down Love,Bob Dylan,"Love that’s pure hopes all things
Believes all things, won’t pull no strings
Won’t sneak up into your room, tall, dark and handsome
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom

You don’t want a love that’s pure
You want to drown love
You want a watered-down love

Love that’s pure, it don’t make no false claims
Intercedes for you ’stead of casting you blame
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression
Won’t write it up and make you sign a false confession


Love that’s pure won’t lead you astray
Won’t hold you back, won’t mess up your day
Won’t pervert you, corrupt you with stupid wishes
It don’t make you envious, it don’t make you suspicious

Love that’s pure ain’t no accident
Always on time, is always content
An eternal flame, quietly burning
Never needs to be proud, restlessly yearning"
We Better Talk This Over,We Better Talk This Over,Bob Dylan,"I think we better talk this over
Maybe when we both get sober
You’ll understand I’m only a man
Doing’ the best that I can

This situation can only get rougher
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Let’s call it a day, go our own different ways
Before we decay
You don’t have to be afraid of looking into my face
We’ve done nothing to each other time will not erase

I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing
I took a chance, got caught in the trance
Of a downhill dance

Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
I’m exiled, you can’t convert me
I’m lost in the haze of your delicate ways
With both eyes glazed
You don’t have to yearn for love, you don’t have to be alone
Somewheres in this universe there’s a place that you can call home

I guess I’ll be leaving tomorrow
If I have to beg, steal or borrow
It’d be great to cross paths in a day and a half
Look at each other and laugh

But I don’t think it’s liable to happen
Like the sound of one hand clapping’
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept
’Neath the bed where we slept

Don’t think of me and fantasize on what we never had
Be grateful for what we’ve shared together and be glad
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Eventually we’ll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope

Oh, babe, time for a new transition
I wish I was a magician
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond
That we’ve both gone beyond"
Wedding Song,Wedding Song,Bob Dylan,"I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love
I love you more than money and more than the stars above
Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea
Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me

Ever since you walked right in, the circle’s been complete
I’ve said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street
To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun
I love you more than ever and I haven’t yet begun

You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live
When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole
Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul

You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife
My thoughts of you don’t ever rest, they’d kill me if I lie
I’d sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die

The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth
We’ll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth
What’s lost is lost, we can’t regain what went down in the flood
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood
It’s never been my duty to remake the world at large
Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge
’Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn’t bend
And if there is eternity I’d love you there again

Oh, can’t you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride
You’re the other half of what I am, you’re the missing piece
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn’t cease

You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see
Just being’ next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on
‘Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone"
Went to See the Gypsy,Went to See the Gypsy,Bob Dylan,"Went to see the gypsy
Staying in a big hotel
He smiled when he saw me coming
And he said, “Well, well, well”
His room was dark and crowded
Lights were low and dim
“How are you?” he said to me
I said it back to him

I went down to the lobby
To make a small call out
A pretty dancing girl was there
And she began to shout
“Go on back to see the gypsy
He can move you from the rear
Drive you from your fear
Bring you through the mirror
He did it in Las Vegas
And he can do it here”

Outside the lights were shining
On the river of tears
I watched them from the distance
With music in my ears
I went back to see the gypsy
It was nearly early dawn
The gypsy’s door was open wide
But the gypsy was gone
And that pretty dancing girl
She could not be found
So I watched that sun come rising
From that little Minnesota town"
West Texas,West Texas,Bob Dylan,"I'm going down to West Texas
Behind the Louisiana line
I'm going down to West Texas
Behind the Louisiana line
Get me that fortune telling woman
Want to let her gonna read my mind
If you ever go to Dallas
Take the right hand road
If you ever go to Dallas
Take the right hand road
For wasting down the street boys
Is bound to kill ya for sure
I'm going down to Jackson River
Past that West Texas line
I'm going down to Jackson River
Behind that West Texas line
If there's a star up above
Lord it's mine, leading my sign
Well you never miss your water
Till the well runs dry
And you never miss your water
Till the well runs dry
And you never miss your man
Till he says goodbye
You can ride and tell my mama
I won't be coming home tonight
You can ride and tell my mother
I won't be home tonight
I'm going down the road boys
I've got to do it right
I'm going down to West Texas
Behind the Louisiana line

Behind the Louisiana line
That fortune telling woman
Won't you let her really read my mind?"
Western Road,Western Road,Bob Dylan,"Well I'm going to Chicago, going on the Western Road
Yes I'm going to Chicago, going?on?the Western Road
There?are good times in Baltimore
But I've?packed this heavy load
Might take a train I might take a plane
But if I have to walk
I'll be going to Chicago just the same
I'm going to Chicago on the Western Road
There's bad times in Baltimore I can't take this load
Have you seen, have you seen, have you seen Miss Mary Anne?
Have you seen, have you seen, have you seen Miss Mary Anne?
Well I want to tell you that's one kind of woman, who is missing her man
Look down the street on Friday and found out she was gone
I looked for her on Thursday but she has moved along
Miss Maggie Anne, has anybody seen Miss Maggie Anne?
Well let me tell you that's one woman
One woman who's sure missing her man"
What Can I Do for You?,What Can I Do for You?,Bob Dylan,"You have given everything to me
What can I do for You?
You have given me eyes to see
What can I do for You?

Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside
Filled up a hunger that had always been denied
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide
And You’ve chosen me to be among the few
What can I do for You?

You have laid down Your life for me
What can I do for You?
You have explained every mystery
What can I do for You?

Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly
He gets wise in his own eyes and he’s made to believe a lie
Who would deliver him from the death he’s bound to die?
Well, You’ve done it all and there’s no more anyone can pretend to do
What can I do for You?
You have given all there is to give
What can I do for You?
You have given me life to live
How can I live for You?

I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts
I don’t care how rough the road is, show me where it starts
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart
Well, I don’t deserve it but I sure did make it through
What can I do for You?"
What Good Am I?,What Good Am I?,Bob Dylan,"What good am I if I’m like all the rest
If I just turn away, when I see how you’re dressed
If I shut myself off so I can’t hear you cry
What good am I?

What good am I if I know and don’t do
If I see and don’t say, if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky
What good am I?

What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don’t try
What good am I?

What good am I then to others and me
If I’ve had every chance and yet still fail to see
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?

What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back while you silently die
What good am I?"
What Was It You Wanted,What Was It You Wanted,Bob Dylan,"What was it you wanted?
Tell me again so I’ll know
What’s happening in there
What’s going on in your show
What was it you wanted
Could you say it again?
I’ll be back in a minute
You can get it together by then

What was it you wanted
You can tell me, I’m back
We can start it all over
Get it back on the track
You got my attention
Go ahead, speak
What was it you wanted
When you were kissing my cheek?

Was there somebody looking
When you give me that kiss
Someone there in the shadows
Someone that I might have missed?
Is there something you needed
Something I don’t understand
What was it you wanted
Do I have it here in my hand?
Whatever you wanted
Slipped out of my mind
Would you remind me again
If you’d be so kind
Has the record been breaking
Did the needle just skip
Is there somebody waiting
Was there a slip of the lip?

What was it you wanted
I ain’t keeping score
Are you the same person
That was here before?
Is it something important?
Maybe not
What was it you wanted?
Tell me again I forgot

Whatever you wanted
What could it be
Did somebody tell you
That you could get it from me
Is it something that comes natural
Is it easy to say
Why do you want it
Who are you anyway?
Is the scenery changing
Am I getting it wrong
Is the whole thing going backwards
Are they playing our song?
Where were you when it started
Do you want it for free
What was it you wanted
Are you talking to me?"
Whatcha Gonna Do?,Whatcha Gonna Do?,Bob Dylan,"Tell me what you’re gonna do
When the shadow comes under your door
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When the shadow comes under your door
Tell me what you’re gonna do
When the shadow comes under your door
O Lord, O Lord

What’ll I Do,What'll I Do,Bob Dylan,"What'll I do?
When you are far away
And I am blue
What'll I do?
What'll I do?
When I am wondering who
Is kissing you
What'll I do?
What'll I do with just a photograph
To tell my troubles to?
When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true
What'll I do?

What'll I do with just a photograph
To tell my troubles to?
When I'm alone
With only dreams of you

When Did You Leave Heaven?,When Did You Leave Heaven?,Bob Dylan,"When did you leave heaven ?
How could they let you go ?
How's every thing in heaven ?
I'd like to know

Why did you trade heaven ?
For all these earthly things ?
Where on earth you hide halo ?
Where did you lose your wings ?

Have they missed you ?
Can you get back in ?
If I kiss you would it be a sin ?
I am only human but you are so divine
When did you leave heaven angel mine ?"
When He Returns,When He Returns,Bob Dylan,"The iron hand, it ain't match for the iron rod
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty God
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears
It is only He who can reduce me to tears
Don’t you cry and don’t you die and don’t you burn
For like a thief in the night, He’ll replace wrong with right
When He returns

Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Will I ever learn that there’ll be no peace, that the war won’t cease
Until He returns?

Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take off your mask
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Of every earthly plan that be known to man, He is unconcerned
He’s got plans of His own to set up His throne
When He returns"
When I Got Troubles,When I Got Troubles,Bob Dylan,"Well I got trouble
Trouble's on my mind
Yep, when I got in trouble
Trouble's on my mind
Well, I'm going to forget my trouble
Leave my trouble behind, behind

I'm going to swing it up
Swing it down
Got the fever, then wham, wham wham!

Well, swing your troubles
Swing your troubles away
Yeah, well, swing baby
Swing your troubles today

Yea, yea, yea, yeah!"
When I Paint My Masterpiece,When I Paint My Masterpiece,Bob Dylan,"Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that you’re seeing double
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I’ve got me a date with Botticelli’s niece
She promised that she’d be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece

Oh, the hours I’ve spent inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions and wasting time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see them
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, everything is going to be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece
Sailing round the world in a dirty gondola
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!

I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling mussels
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, everything is going to be different
When I paint my masterpiece"
When You Awake,When You Awake,Bob Dylan,"Ollie told me I'm a fool
So I walked on down the road a mile
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee, and what do you think he said to me?

When you awake you will remember ev'rything
You will be hangin' on a string from your...
When you believe, you will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know
Ollie showed me the fork in the road
You can take to the left or go straight to the right
Use your days and save your nights
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
But what am I supposed to do:
Read the writing on the wall
I heard it when I was very small

Wash my hand in lye water, I got a date with the Captain's daughter
You can go and tell your brother
We sure gonna love one another, oh! you
May be right and ya might be wrong
I ain't gonna worry all day long
Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite
My old car froze up last night
Ain't no reason to hang your head I could wake up in the mornin' dead
Oh! and if I thought it would do any good
I'd stand on the rock where Moses stood"
When You Gonna Wake Up,When You Gonna Wake Up,Bob Dylan,"God don’t make no promises that He don’t keep
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts
Karl Marx has got ya by the throat and Henry Kissinger’s got you tied up in knots

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that’ll never cure your ills

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

You got men who can’t hold their peace and women who can’t control their tongues
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young
When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move
Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
You think He’s just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
You can’t take it with you and you know that it’s too worthless to be sold
They tell you, “Time is money,” as if your life was worth its weight in gold

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

There’s a Man up on a cross and He’s been crucified for you
Beleive in  His power, it's all about you got to do

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?"
When the Deal Goes Down,When the Deal Goes Down,Bob Dylan,"In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light
Where wisdom grows up in strife
My bewildering brain, toils in vain
Through the darkness on the pathways of life
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air
Tomorrow keeps turning around
We live and we die, we know not why
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down

We eat and we drink, we feel and we think
Far down the street we stray
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Things I never meant nor wished to say
The midnight rain follows the train
We all wear the same thorny crown
Soul to soul, our shadows roll
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down

The moon gives light and shines by night
I scarcely feel the glow
We learn to live and then we forgive
O'er the road we're bound to go
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
That keep us so tightly bound
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes
I followed the winding stream
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys
I know they're not what they seem
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
You'll never see me frown
I owe my heart to you, and that's saying' it true
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down"
When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky,When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky,Bob Dylan,"Look out across the fields, see me returning
Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning
You’ve had time to think about it for a while

Well, I’ve walked two hundred miles, now look me over
It’s the end of the chase and the moon is high
It won’t matter who loves who
You’ll love me or I’ll love you
When the night comes falling from the sky

I can see through your walls and I know you’re hurting
Sorrow covers you up like a cape
Only yesterday I know that you’ve been flirting
With disaster that you managed to escape

I can’t provide for you no easy answers
Who are you that I should have to lie?
You’ll know all about it, love
It’ll fit you like a glove
When the night comes falling from the sky
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
You must have been protecting someone last time I called
I’ve never asked you for nothing you couldn’t deliver
I’ve never asked you to set yourself up for a fall

I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness
For the love of a lousy buck, I’ve watched them die
Stick around, baby, we’re not through
Don’t look for me, I’ll see you
When the night comes falling from the sky

In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line
I don’t want to be a fool starving for affection
I don’t want to drown in someone else’s wine

For all eternity I think I will remember
That icy wind that’s howling in your eye
You will seek me and you’ll find me
In the wasteland of your mind
When the night comes falling from the sky
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter
But you were gambling for support
This time tomorrow I’ll know you better
When my memory is not so short

This time I’m asking for freedom
Freedom from a world which you deny
And you’ll give it to me now
I’ll take it anyhow
When the night comes falling from the sky"
When the Ship Comes In,When the Ship Comes In,Bob Dylan,"Oh, the time will come up
When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind
Before the hurricane begins
The hour that the ship comes in
And the sea will split
And the ships will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound
And the waves will pound
And the mornin' will be a-breakin'
The fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls, they'll be smilin'
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in
And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean
A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in
Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'
Oh, the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And they'll know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in
And they'll raise their hands
Sayin', ""We'll meet all your demands""
But we'll shout from the bow, ""Your days are numbered""
And like Pharoah's tribe
They'll be drowned in the tide
And like Goliath, they'll be conquered"
When the World Was Young,When the World Was Young,Bob Dylan,"It isn't by chance I happen to be
A boulevardier, the toast of Paris
For over the noise, the talk and the smoke
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke
I walk in a room, a party or ball
""Come sit over here"" somebody will call
""A drink for M'sieur, a drink for us all""
But how many times I stop and recall
Ah, the apple trees
Blossoms in the breeze
That we walked among
Lyin' in the hay
Games we used to play
While the rounds were sung
Only yesterday, when the world was young
Wherever I go they mention my name
And that in itself, is some sort of fame
""Come by for a drink, we're havin' a game""
Wherever I go I'm glad that I came
The talk is quite gay, the company fine
There's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine
And beautiful girls and some of 'em mine
But often my eyes see a different shine
Ah, the apple trees
Sunlit memories
Where the hammock swung
On our backs we'd lie
Looking at the sky
'Til the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young"
Where Are You Tonight?,Where Are You Tonight?,Bob Dylan,"There's a long-distance train rolling through the rain
Tears on the letter I write
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missin' her so much
But she's drifting like a satellite
There's a neon light ablaze in a green smoky haze
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street
There's a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than street-wise
But he practiced what he preached from the heart
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me
The time and the place that we'd part
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page
Of a book that nobody can write
Oh, where are you tonight?
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure
To live it you had to explode
In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed
Sacrifice was the code of the road
I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John
Strong men belittled by doubt
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were
But she had some way of finding them out
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
And discovered her invisible self
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape
Well I won't, but then maybe again, I might
Oh, if I could just find you tonight
I fought with my twin, that enemy within
Till both of us fell by the way
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
While the law looks the other way
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes
The man you were lovin' could never get clean
It felt out of place, my foot in his face
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
With the juice running down my leg
Then I dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss
Who always was too proud to beg
There's a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
And a pathway that leads up to the stars
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise
Just remind me to show you the scars
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived
If I'm-a there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived
I can't believe it, I can't believe I'm alive
But without you it doesn't seem right
Oh, where are you tonight?"
Where Are You?,Where Are You?,Bob Dylan,"Where are you, where have you gone without me
I thought you cared about me, where are you
Where's my heart, where is the dream we started
I can't believe we're parted, where are you
When we said, goodbye, love, what had we to gain
When I gave you my love, was it all in vain
All life through, must I go on pretending
Where is my happy ending, where are you
When we said, goodbye, love, what had we to gain
When I gave you my love, was it all in vain
All life through, must I go on pretending
Where is that happy ending, where are you, where are you"
Where Is the One?,Where Is the One?,Bob Dylan,"Where is the one
Who'll end the search I'm making
Where is the one
Who'll change my dream to waking
Behind some far off secret door
There's my love
There's my life
In store
The journey's long
Much longer than I reckoned
In any throng
I'll know her in a second
Some lucky day
I'm bound to find her
And when I do
I'll find love
The journey's long
Much longer than I reckoned
In any throng
I'll know her in a second
Some lucky day
I'm bound to find her
And when I do
I'll find love"
Where Teardrops Fall,Where Teardrops Fall,Bob Dylan,"Far away where the soft winds blow
Far away from it all
There is a place you go
Where teardrops fall

Far away in the stormy night
Far away and over the wall
You are there in the flickering light
Where teardrops fall

We banged the drum slowly
And played the fife lowly
You know the song in my heart
In the turning of twilight
In the shadows of moonlight
You can show me a new place to start

I’ve torn my clothes and I’ve drained the cup
Stripping away at it all
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Where teardrops fall
By rivers of blindness
In love and with kindness
We could hold up a toast if we meet
To the cutting of fences
To sharpen the senses
That linger in the fireball heat

Roses are red, violets are blue
And time is beginning to crawl
I just might have to come see you
Where teardrops fall"
White Dove,White Dove,Bob Dylan,"In the deep rolling hills of old Virginia
There's a place that I love so well
Where I spent many days of my childhood
In the cabin where we loved to dwell
White dove will mourn in sorrow
The willows will hang their heads
I'll live my life in sorrow
Since mother and daddy are dead
We were all so happy there together
In our peaceful little mountain home
But the Savior needs angels up in heaven
Now they sing around the great white throne
As the years roll by I often wonder
If we will all be together someday
And each night as I wander through the graveyard
Darkness finds me as I kneel to pray"
Who Killed Davey Moore?,Who Killed Davey Moore?,Bob Dylan,"Who killed Davey Moore?
Why, and what’s the reason for?

“Not I,” says the referee
“Don’t point your finger at me
I could’ve stopped it in the eighth
And maybe kept him from his fate
But the crowd would’ve booed, I’m sure
At not getting their money’s worth
It’s too bad he had to go
But there was a pressure on me too, you know
It wasn’t me that made him fall
No, you can’t blame me at all”

“Not us,” says the angry crowd
Whose screams filled the arena loud

We just meant to see some sweat

Puffing on a big cigar

Who killed Davey Moore?
Why, and what’s the reason for?

“Not me,” says the boxing writer
Pounding print on his old typewriter
Saying, “Boxing is not to blame
There’s just as much danger in a football game”
Saying, “Fist fighting is here to stay
It’s just the old American way
It wasn’t me that made him fall
No, you can’t blame me at all”

Who killed Davey Moore?
Why, and what’s the reason for?

“Not me,” says the man whose fists
Laid him low in a cloud of mist
Who came here from Cuba’s door
Where boxing is not allowed no more
“I hit him, yes, it’s true
But that’s what I am paid to do
Don’t say ‘murder,’ don’t say ‘kill’
It was destiny, it was God’s will”
Who killed Davey Moore?
Why, and what’s the reason for?"
Why Try to Change Me Now,Why Try to Change Me Now,Bob Dylan,"I'm sentimental, so I walk in the rain
I've got some habits even I can't explain
Could start for the corner, turn up in Spain
But why try to change me now?
I sit and daydream, I've got daydreams galore
Cigarette ashes, there they go on the floor
I'll go away weekends, leave my keys in the door
But why try to change me now?
Why can't I be more conventional?
People talk, people stare, so I try
But that's not for me, cause I can't see
My kind of crazy world go passing me by
So, let people wonder, let 'em laugh, let 'em frown
You know I'll love you till the moon's upside down
Don't you remember I was always your clown?
Why try to change me now?
Don't you remember I was always your clown?
But why try to change me
Why try to change me now?"
Why Was I Born?,Why Was I Born?,Bob Dylan,"Why was I born tell me why I am living
What do I give or what am I'm giving
What do I want anything I can not hope for
What can I hope for I wish I knew
Why do I try to draw you near me
Honey tell me why do I cry
Cause you're never gonna hear me
I'm a poor fool
But what can I do, I do
Why was I born to love you
Why do I try to draw you near me
Honey tell me why do I cry
Cause you're never gonna hear me
I'm a poor fool
But what can I do, I do
Why was I born to love you"

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue
Wiggle till the moon sees you

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees
Wiggle on your hands and knees

Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear
Wiggle till you wiggle right out of here
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead
Wiggle—you can raise the dead

Wiggle till you’re high, wiggle till you’re higher
Wiggle till you vomit fire
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake
Wiggle like a big fat snak"

Wild Mountain Thyme,Wild Mountain Thyme,Bob Dylan,"Oh, the summer time is coming
And the leaves are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Blooms around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie go
And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
From all around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie go
If my true love she won't go
Oh, I'll sure find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
From all around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie go"
Wildwood Flower,Wildwood Flower,Bob Dylan,"Oh, I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with the emerald hue
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue
Oh I'll dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming, my idols were clay
All portion of love had all flown away
Oh he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He's left me no warning, no words of farewell
Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
That was blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower"
Winter Wonderland,Winter Wonderland,Bob Dylan,"(Wonderland)
(Winter wonderland)
(Wonderland)

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is a bluebird
In his place is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?"" We'll say, ""No, man""
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids all knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrillin'
Though your nose gets a chillin'
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland
(Ooh)"
Winterlude,Winterlude,Bob Dylan,"Winterlude, Winterlude, oh darling
Winterlude by the road tonight
Tonight there will be no quarreling
Everything is gonna be all right
Oh, I see by the angel beside me
That love has a reason to shine
You’re the one I adore, come over here and give me more
Then Winterlude, this dude thinks you’re fine

Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple
Winterlude by the corn in the field
Winterlude, let’s go down to the chapel
Then come back and cook up a meal
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens
By the sun, near the old crossroads sign
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold
Winterlude, don’t be rude, please be mine

Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy
Winterlude by the telephone wire
Winterlude, it’s making me lazy
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire
The moonlight reflects from the window
Where the snowflakes, they cover the sand
Come out tonight, everything will be tight
Winterlude, this dude thinks you’re grand"
With God on Our Side,With God on Our Side,Bob Dylan,"Oh my name it ain't nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I’s taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that the land that I live in
Has God on its side
Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Ah the country was young
With God on its side
The Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I’s made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side
The First World War boys
It came and it went
The reason for fightin'
I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don’t count the dead
When God’s on your side
The Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side
I’ve learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
It’s them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side
But now we got weapons
Of chemical dust
If fire them we’re forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And ya' never ask questions
When God’s on your side
Through many dark hour
I been thinking about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can’t think for ya'
You’ll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side
So now as I’m leavin'
I’m weary as Hell
The confusion I’m feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And they fall to the floor
If God’s on our side
He’ll stop the next war"
Working on a Guru,Working on a Guru,Bob Dylan,"Rain all around, windshield wipers movin'
Water on the ground, sure don't feel like groovin'
Working on a guru
Working on a guru
Working on a guru, before the sun goes down
Rain all around, I need me an umbrella
Water on the ground, I am that kind of fella
Looking for a guru
Working on a guru
Working on a guru, before the sun goes down
Walking on the street, I need me an umbrella
Just to keep it sweet, I am that kind of fella
Looking for a guru
Working on a guru
Working on a guru, before the sun goes down
Rain on the ground, windshield wipers movin'
Water all around, I sure don't feel like groovin'
I'm working on a guru
Yes, I'm working on a guru
But I'm working on a guru, before the sun goes down
Working on a guru
Working on a guru
Well, it's true, it could be you
I'm working on a guru"
Workingman’s Blues #2,Workingman's Blues #2,Bob Dylan,"There's an evening' haze settlin' over the town
Starlight by the edge of the creek
The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
Money's gettin' shallow and weak
The place I love best is a sweet memory
It's a new path that we trod
They say low wages are a reality
If we want to compete abroad

My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
Come sit down on my knee
You are dearer to me than myself
As you yourself can see
I'm listening' to the steel rails hum
Got both eyes tight shut
Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
Creeping it's way into my gut

Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
Now, I'm sailing' on back, ready for the long haul
Tossed by the winds and the seas
I'll drag them all down to hell and I'll stand them at the wall
I'll sell them to their enemies
I'm trying' to feed my soul with thought
Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
Sometimes no one wants what we got
Sometimes you can't give it away

Now the place is ringed with countless foes
Some of them may be deaf and dumb
No man, no woman knows
The hour that sorrow will come
In the dark I hear the night birds call
I can hear a lover's breath
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
Sleep is like a temporary death


Well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse
I can't save a dime
I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced
Into a life of continual crime
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
How I wish you were here to see
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking
That you have forgotten me?
Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
They waste your nights and days
Them I will forget
But you I'll remember always
Old memories of you to me have clung
You've wounded me with words
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
It's all true, everything you have heard


In you, my friend, I find no blame
Wanna look in my eyes, please do
No one can ever claim
That I took up arms against you
All across the peaceful sacred fields
They will lay you low
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
I say it so it must be so

Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
Gonna give you another chance
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you
To lead me off in a cheerful dance
Got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
I can live on rice and beans
Some people never worked a day in their life
Don't know what work even means"
World Gone Wrong,World Gone Wrong,Bob Dylan,"Strange things have happened, like never before
My baby told me I would have to go
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home
No use in worrying, 'cause the world gone wrong
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

I told you, baby, right to your head
If I didn't leave you I would have to kill you dead
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

I tried to be loving and treat you kind
But it seems like you never right, you got no loyal mind
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind
Praise the Good Lord to get her out of your mind
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

Said, when you been good now, can't do no more
Just tell her kindly, ""there is the front door.""
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong"

Ye Shall Be Changed,Ye Shall Be Changed,Bob Dylan,"You harbor resentment
You know there ain’t too much of a thrill
You wish for contentment
But you got an emptiness that can’t be filled
You’ve had enough of hatred
Your bones are breaking, can’t find nothing sacred

Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And ye shall be changed

Everything you’ve gotten
You’ve gotten by sweat, blood and muscle
From early in the morning ’till way past dark
All you ever do is hustle
All your loved ones have walked out the door
You’re not even sure ’bout your wife and kids no more, but


The past don’t control you
But the future’s like a roulette wheel spinning
Deep down inside
You know you need a whole new beginning
Don’t have to go to Russia or Iran
Just surrender to God and He’ll move you right here where you stand, and

You drink bitter water
And you been eating the bread of sorrow
You can’t live for today
When all you’re ever thinking of is tomorrow
The path you’ve endured has been rough
When you’ve decided that you’ve had enough, then"
You Ain’t Goin’ Nowhere,You Ain't Goin' Nowhere,Bob Dylan,"Clouds so swift, the rain falling in

Ooh-wee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come
Ooh-wee, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair
Genghis Khan and his brother Don
Couldn't keep on keeping on
We'll climb that bridge after it's gone
After we're way past it
Ooh-wee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come
Ooh-wee, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings
A flute that toots and a bee that stings
The sky that cries and a bird that flies
A fish that walks and a dog that talks
Ooh-wee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come
Ooh-wee, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair
Ooh-wee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come
Ooh-wee, are we gonna fly

You angel, you
You're as fine as anything's fine
I just walk and watch you talk
With you memory of my mind
You know I can't sleep at night for trying
Yes I never did feel this way before
Never did get up and walk the floor
If this is love then gimme more
And more and more and more and more
You angel, you
You're as fine as can be
The way you walk and the way you talk
Is the way it ought to be
And oh, I can't sleep at night for trying
Never did feel this way before
Never did get up and walk the floor
If this is love then gimme more
And more and more and more
You angel, you
You got me under your wing
The way you walk and the way you talk
I swear it would make me sing"
You Are My Sunshine,You Are My Sunshine (Ft. Johnny Cash),Bob Dylan,"The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
But?when?I awoke, dear,?I was mistaken
So I hung my?head and I cried
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me and love another
You'll regret it all some day:
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between
But not you've left me and love another;
You have shattered all of my dreams:
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me
When I awake my poor heart pains
So when you come back and make me happy
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away"
You Belong to Me,You Belong to Me,Bob Dylan,"See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sun rise from a tropic isle
Just remember, darling, all the while
You belong to me
See the market place in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too... and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too... and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me"
You Changed My Life,You Changed My Life,Bob Dylan,"I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Singing about conspiracy, wanted me to be afraid
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust
Suffered ridicule and wanting to give it all up in disgust

But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life

Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end


Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal
I do it myself, it's not so unreal
The call of the wild is forever at my door
Wants me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor

I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray
I was told i was looking good and to have a nice day
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite
Eating that absolute garbage while being so discreet


You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm
While orphans of man danced to the beat of the palm
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass
In the world you had made they made you an outcast


There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Invading my privacy making my decisions for me
Holding me back, not letting me stand
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land

My Lord and my Savior, my companion, my friend
Heart fixer, mind regulator, true to the end
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy
What the world is set against but will never destroy"
You Don’t Have to Do That,You Don't Have to Do That,Bob Dylan,"You say that you're fed up

I just wanna ask you
Honey where are you at?
'Cause i tell you all the time
You don't have to do that"
You Go to My Head,You Go to My Head,Bob Dylan,"You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two
The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be
You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head"
You Wanna Ramble,You Wanna Ramble,Bob Dylan,"Well I told my baby

You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn

Well, the night is so empty
So quit and still
For only fifteen
Hundred dollars
You can have anybody killed
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
Well, I told my baby
Further down the line
I said, ""What happens tomorrow
Is on your head, not mine""
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn"
You Win Again,You Win Again,Bob Dylan,"All over town
That you've been seen, a-runnin' 'round
I know that I should leave but then
I just can't go, you win again
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knew but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
What can I do, you win again
I'm sorry for your victim now
Ah, soon his head like mine will bow
Yes, he give his heart but all in vain
As some they say, you win again
You have no heart, you have no shame
You take too long and give the blame
I guess I should not complain
I love you still, you win again"
Young at Heart,Young at Heart,Bob Dylan,"Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you when you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart
You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on it's way
Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart
And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart"
You’re A Big Girl Now [Hard Rain],You're A Big Girl Now [Hard Rain],Bob Dylan,"Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me off-a my feet
And I’m back in?the?rain, oh, oh
And?you are on dry land
You made?it there somehow
You’re a big girl now
Bird on the horizon, sittin’ on a fence
He’s singin’ his song for me at his own expense
And I’m just like that bird, oh, oh
Singin’ just for you
I hope that you can hear
Hear me singin’ through these tears
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh, but what a shame if all we’ve shared can’t last
I can change, I swear, oh, oh
See what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
You’ve known it all the time, I’m learnin’ it these days
Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh
In somebody’s room
It’s a price I have to pay
You’re a big girl all the way
A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But what’s the sense of changing horses in midstream?
I’m going out of my mind, oh, oh
With a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we’ve been apart"
You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,Bob Dylan,"I’ve seen love go by my door
It’s never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
I've been shooting in the dark too long
When something’s not right, it’s wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Dragon clouds so high above
I’ve only known careless love
It always just hit me from below
But this time 'round it’s more correct
Right on target, so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Purple clover, Queen Anne's lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry, if you don’t know
Can’t remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoilin’ me too much, love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time
Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud
But there’s no way I can compare
All them scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

You're gonna make me wonder what I’m doin’
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I’m sayin’
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to

I’ll look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco or Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know
But I’ll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass, in the ones I love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go"
You’re Gonna Quit Me,You're Gonna Quit Me,Bob Dylan,"You're going to quit me, baby
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you

Give you my money, honey
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lawd, Lawd


Six months on the chain gang
Believe me, it is no fun, Lawd, Lawd


Jailhouse is no plaything
Believe me, is no lie, Lawd, Lawd"
You’re No Good,You're No Good,Bob Dylan,"Well, I don't know why I love you like I do
Nobody in the world can get along with you
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den
I come home last night you wouldn't even let me in

Oh sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be
Oh when you get the crazy notion of jumping all over me
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
When you give me the blues I want to lay down and die


I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama
I helped you when you had no food to eat
Now you're the kind of woman that just don't understand
You're taking all my money and give it to another man

Well, you're that kind of woman makes a man lose his brains
You're that kind of woman drives a man insane
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
You give me the blues, I want to lay down and die"
You’re a Big Girl Now,You’re a Big Girl Now,Bob Dylan,"Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me off-a my feet
And I'm back in the rain, oh, oh
And you are on dry land
You made it there somehow
You're a big girl now

Bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence
He's singing his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird, oh, oh
Singing just for you
I hope that you can hear
Hear me singing through these tears

Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh, but what a shame that all we've shared can't last
I can change, I swear, oh, oh
See what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too

Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days
Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh
In somebody's room
It's a price I have to pay
You're a big girl all the way
A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
I'm going out of my mind, oh, oh
With a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart"
’Cross the Green Mountain,’Cross the Green Mountain,Bob Dylan,"I cross the green mountain, I slept by the stream
Heaven blazin' in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream
Somethin' came up out of the sea
Swept through the land of the rich and the free
I look into the eyes of my merciful friend
And then I ask myself, is this the end?
Memories linger, sad yet sweet
And I think of the souls in heaven who will meet
Altars are burnin' with flames far and wide
The foe has crossed over from the other side
They tip their caps from the top of the hill
You can feel them come, more brave blood to spill
Along the dim Atlantic line
The ravaged land lies for miles behind
The light's comin' forward and the streets are broad
All must yield to the avengin' God
The world is old, the world is gray
Lessons of life can't be learned in a day
I watch and I wait and I listen while I stand
To the music that comes from a far better land
Close the eyes of our captain, peace may he know
His long night is done, the great leader is laid low
He was ready to fall, he was quick to defend
Killed outright he was, by his own men
It's the last day's last hour of the last happy year
I feel that the unknown world is so near
Pride will vanish and glory will rot
But virtue lives and cannot be forgot
The bells of the evening have rung
There's blasphemy on every tongue
Let 'em say that I walked in fair nature's light
And that I was loyal to truth and to right
Serve God and be cheerful, look upward, beyond
Beyond the darkness of masks, the surprises of dawn
In the deep green grasses of the blood stained wood
They never dreamed of surrenderin', they fell where they stood
Stars fell over Alabama, I saw each star
You're walkin' in dreams, whoever you are
Chilled are the skies, keen is the frost
The grounds froze hard and the morning is lost
A letter to mother came today
Gun shot wound to the breast is what it did say
But he'll be better soon, he's in a hospital bed
But he'll never be better, he's already dead
I'm ten miles outside the city and I'm lifted away
In an ancient light that is not of day
They were calm, they were blunt, we knew 'em all too well
We loved each other more than we ever dared to tell"

Beware the savage jaw of 1984

They'll split your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell that you're eighty, but brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's neverthere
Beware the savage jaw of 1984

Please make sure we get tomorrow
All this pain and all the sorrow

I demand a better future
Or I might just stop needing you

Give my children sunny smiles

Give them moon and cloudless skies

Or I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you

When we talk, we talk to you
When we walk, we walk to you
From factory to field
How many tears must fall
Down there below
Nothing is moving

A Foggy Day (In London Town),A Foggy Day (In London Town) (Ft. Angelo Badalamenti),David Bowie,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do? What to do? What to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town
Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The British Museum had lost its charm
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?
But the age of miracles hadn't passed
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London Town
The sun was shining everywhere"
A Small Plot of Land,A Small Plot of Land,David Bowie,"Poor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him and it hit him so

Poor dunce
He pushed back the pigmen
The Barbs laughed
The fool is dead
Poor dunce
He's less than within us
The brains talk
But the will to live is dead
And prayer can't travel so far these days

The talk of your life
Standing so near
To innocent eyes
Poor dunce
Swings through the tunnels
And claws his way
Is small life so manic
Are these really the days
Poor dunce, poor dunce


Poor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him and it hit him so


People spat upon him

There's nothing much to take
I'm an absolute beginner
And I'm absolutely sane
As long as we're together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same

If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean
Just like the films
There's no reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true

Nothing much could happen
Nothing we can't shake
Oh we're absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as you're still smiling
There's nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
But if my love is your love
We're certain to succeed
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Sail over heartaches
Just like the films
If there's reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true"
Across the Universe,Across the Universe (Ft. John Lennon),David Bowie,"Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letterbox
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on and on across the universe
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

Nothing, nothing, nothing

I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller

But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe we're not alone
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown

And I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid
On my own
On my own

What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds

If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile
And I won't feel afraid
No I won't feel afraid
I won't be, be afraid anymore

Anymore
(And then I just won't be afraid)
Anymore

Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life, quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one left unnamed
Seems like another day I could fly

Wise like orangutan, that was me

To the far side of town
Where the thin men stalk the streets
While the sane stay underground

Day after day
They tell me I can go
They tell me I can blow
To the far side of town
Where it's pointless to be high
Because it's such a long way down

So I tell them that
I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm
I will do me harm
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all (am I?)
Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be
Just my librium and me
And my E.S.T. makes three
'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me

Where can the horizon lie
When a nation hides
Its organic minds in a cellar, dark and grim
They must be very dim

Day after day
They take some brain away
Then turn my face around
To the far side of town
And tell me that it's real
Then ask me how I feel

Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all
Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be
My libido's split on me
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy

Than perish with the sadmen roaming free
And I'd rather play here

Always Crashing in the Same Car,Always Crashing in the Same Car,David Bowie,"Every chance, every chance that I take
I take it on the road
Those kilometers and the red lights
I was always looking left and right

Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car

Jasmine, I saw you peeping
As I pushed my foot down to the floor
I was going round and round the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to 94

Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car
Yeah, yeah"
America,America,David Bowie,"Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
I've got some real estate here in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes, and Mrs. Wagner pies

And we walked off to look for America

Cathy, I said, as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburg
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw


Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gaberdine suit was a spy
I said be careful, his bowtie is really a camera
Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field
Cathy, I'm lost, I said, though I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and I'm aching and I don't know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey turnpike


Counting the cars on the New Jersey turnpike"
Amsterdam,Amsterdam,David Bowie,"In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps to the old willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries in a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn by the dawn's early light
In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails, that can swallow the moon
And he yells to the cook with his arms open wide
""Hey! Bring me more fish, throw it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch but he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs and he zips up his fly
In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night with their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow underneath the street lamps
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies to a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue, their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins, well, he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky and he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry on the unfaithful love
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam"
An Occasional Dream,An Occasional Dream,David Bowie,"I recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of a Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise...
Some things we could do

In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An Occasional Dream

And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
Between the sheets of summer
Bathed in blue...
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago
And I still can't touch your name
For the days of fate
Were strong for you...
Danced you far from me
In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine"
Andy Warhol,Andy Warhol,David Bowie,"Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all

Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wakes up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint
And he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall

Can't tell them apart at all

As the World Falls Down,As the World Falls Down,David Bowie,"There's such a sad love
Deep in your eyes
A kind of pale jewel
Open and closed
Within your eyes
I'll place the sky
Within your eyes
There's such a fooled heart
Beating so fast
In search of new dreams
A love that will last
Within your heart
I'll place the moon
Within your heart

As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill is gone
Wasn't too much fun at all
But I'll be there for you-ou-ou
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling down
Falling in love
I'll paint you mornings of gold
I'll spin you Valentine evenings
Though we're strangers until now
We're choosing the path
Between the stars
I'll leave my love
Between the stars

Makes no sense for you
Every thrill is gone
Wasn't too much fun at all

In such an early song?
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the Action Man
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed to love
Sordid details following""
The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
And I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too""
One flash of light, but no smoking pistol
I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, whoa whoa
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom

Baal’s Hymn,Baal's Hymn,David Bowie,"Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal
Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it, when he came to us
That same sky remained with him in joy and care
Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware
At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal
Turning pious as the sky grows pale
So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar
Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go
When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far
He will have his sky down there below
When the sinners congregate in shame together
Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress
Only sky, a sky that will go on forever
Formed a blanket for his nakedness
And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield
To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs
Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed
Baal survived it, he just used his eyes
And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round
He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room
""Space enough"" said Baal, ""then I'll thicken the ground
Space enough within this woman's womb""
Any vice for Baal has got its useful side
It's the man who practices it, he can't abide
Vices have their point, once you see it as such
Stick to two for one will be too much
Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun
Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun
Lots of strength is needed and experience too
Swollen bellies can embarrass you
Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears
Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears
Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth
Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep
Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky
As they wait up there to see if Baal will die
Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop
Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup
When the dark womb drags him down to its prize
What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed
So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes
He'll just have enough sky when he's dead
Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal
Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it when he lived with us"

I rode a horse through many a town
But the devil rode me down to the ground
I was to marry a very rich girl
I loved her as only I can
But the father was shot and his gold was stoled
And now I'm the devil's man, na na na
And now I sing a tail of woe
Through the bars of the county jail
I walked into the room one night
I found her mother and gun
Well the man was dead and I kneeled and cried
The sheriff ran in and said I'm holding you, son
Through the day I sing and play
For time is on my side
But when the moon and stars come out
I lay me down and cry
For the Saviour mar I lied
Now I will not have a ride

I've got you babe

Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

Sun comes up and the man goes down
And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear (Black tie, white noise)
Then we jump thru hoops, we're divisible now
Just disappear

Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing ""We Shall Overcome""
What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come thru, don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me, no
But I look into your eyes and I wonder sometimes
Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

Oh Lord, just let him see me
Lord, Lord, just let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together

Reach over race and hold each other's hands
Walk thru the nite thinking ""We Are the World""
What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come thru don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
And I turn my back and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me, no
But I wonder why
Yes, I wonder why sometimes

Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise
They'll show us how to break the rules
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
(Black tie, white noise)
Facist cries both black and white
Who's got the blood, who's got the gun?

Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise
(Just a fool!)"
Blackout,Blackout,David Bowie,"Oh you, you walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
(Your scalding face)
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage
It's too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
(Your fearful hands)

Get me to the doctor's, I've been told
Someone's back in town, the chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence and my honour’s at stake
The weather's grim, ice on the cages
Me, I'm Robin Hood, and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming

If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose, nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain, kiss you in the rain
(Kiss you in the rain) Kiss you in the rain (Kiss you in the rain)
In the rain (In the rain)
Get me to the doctor

Get me off the streets
(Get some protection)
Get me on my feet
(Get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Oh, get me off the streets
Get some protection
Oh get me on my feet (wo-ooh!)
While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure to the blackout
(Get some protection)
Get me on my feet
(Get some direction, wo-ooh!)
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets
(Get some protection)"

Bombers,Bombers,David Bowie,"All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
Seemed a good idea
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Only one man could be seen
And he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair
And the red light flashed, beware
Pilot felt quite big-time
As the bomb sailed through the air
Well, they danced and sang
When the bang went bang
When the lights popped out
And the smoke began to clear
It was positively queer
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
""Die"" said the General
""Cobblers"" said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable
And the Queen a telegram
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones
Ripped apart that sand
'Til the stench was just revolting
And the sky a greenish tan
But the soldier said ""Sir
There's a crack in the world""
And the figures went ""squash""
And the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed!
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
When the smoke had blown away
There was nothing left to view
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you
Floating high up in the sky"
Born in a UFO,Born in a UFO,David Bowie,"Born in a UFO
She was born in a UFO

I come to the glade and watch the saucer land
She glided through the mist in an a-line skirt
Booted her shoes like hooves in the dirt
Her clutch bag reflected the sun and steel
The 50's movie, so many squealed
There’s no direction home she pleads
She cornered me against the trees
I was home I thought, my life could start

She was not like the other girls
I was born under a stone
We were born with a single voice
She was born in a UFO
Born in a UFO

My friends sit around at the end of town
With their heads in their hands in the cool twilight air
I can see by their eyes that they’re bitching sore
I’d rather be dead than fool around here anymore
She was all courage, geometric face
Electric skin, plastic and lace
Silver hair, trapezoid flanks
I was so in love with her lavender vest
She was not like the other girls
I was born under a stone
We were born with a single voice
She was born in a UFO
Like outer space

Born in a UFO
She was born in a UFO
Born in a UFO
She was born in a UFO"
Boss of Me,Boss of Me,David Bowie,"Tell me when you're sad
I wanna make it cool again
I know you're feeling bad
Tell me when you're cool again

Who would have ever thought of it?
Who would have ever dreamed?
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me

You fly through the night
With tears on your lips
Life has your mind and soul
It spins on your hips

Who would have ever thought of it?
Who would have ever dreamed?
Who would have ever thought of it?
Who would have ever dreamed?
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
You know that me and you we fall free through skies
I look to the stars as they flicker and float in your eyes
And under these wings of steel the small town dies

Who would have ever thought of it?
Who would have ever dreamed?
Who would have ever thought of it?
Who would have ever dreamed?
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me

Boys Keep Swinging,Boys Keep Swinging,David Bowie,"Heaven loves ya
The clouds part for ya
Nothing stands in your way when you're a boy
Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry when you're a boy

When you're a boy, you can wear a uniform
When you're a boy, other boys check you out
You get a girl, these are your favorite things
When you're a boy

Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

Uncage the colors, unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello
When you're a boy
They'll never clone you, you are always first on the line
When you're a boy
When you're a boy, you can buy a home of your own
When you're a boy, learn to drive and everything
You'll get your share
When you're a boy

Bring Me the Disco King,Bring Me the Disco King,David Bowie,"You promised me the ending would be clear
You'd let me know when the time was now
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Stab me in the dark, let me disappear
Memories that flutter like bats out of hell
Stab you from the city spires
Life wasn't worth the balance
Or the crumpled paper it was written on

Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible

Hot cash days that you trailed around
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass
Led me down a river of perfumed limbs
Sent me to the streets with the good time girls

Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible

We could dance, dance, dance through the fire
Dance, dance, dance through the fire
Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king

Spin-offs with those who slept like corpses
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
Killing time in the '70s
Smelling of love through the moist winds
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Close me in the dark, let me disappear
Soon there'll be nothing left of me
Nothing left to release

Dance, dance, dance through the fire
Dance, dance, dance through the fire

Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king"
Buddha of Suburbia,Buddha of Suburbia,David Bowie,"Living in lies by the railway line
Pushing the hair from my eyes
Elvis is English and climbs the hills
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies
Screaming along in South London
Vicious but ready to learn
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer
Sometimes but always in vain

So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane

Down on my knees in Suburbia
Down on myself in every way

With great expectations I change all my clothes
Mustn't grumble at silver and gold
Screaming above Central London
Never bored, so I'll never get old
So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane

Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way

Day after, day after day, day after
Zane, Zane, Zane, Ouvre le chien
Day after day, day after
Zane, Zane, Zane, Ouvre le chien
Day after"
Buzz The Fuzz,Buzz The Fuzz,David Bowie,"Once there was a fellow and his name was Buzz
He was just a rookie cop, just a baby Fuzz
He patroled the Sunset Strip in the land of the free and the home of the hip
He protected you and me until he met a girl called Alice D
Alice was the girl that all the hippies dread
And they called her sweet Alice the head
Alice it was plain to see, was full of pot and LSD
She'd attract a great big crowd, because her inner piece was much too loud
Good Buzz did the thing that good Fuzz must
Stuck his gun in Alice's back and said ""This is a bust""
Shone the flashlight in her eyes, she began to hypnotise
Buzz said ""What a wild sensation, guess this must be hallucination""
Love is so sensational, when you fall in love with eyes dilational
Now they're taking pills in shops, Buzz is not afraid of Watts
Buzz and Alice D have shown the way of where the fuzz might be some day
Buzz is still a cop of course, he's the pusher on the porch
He's protecting you and me from evil women like poor Alice D"
Cactus,Cactus,David Bowie,"Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
I put it on when I go lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me?

I miss your kissing and I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
Just run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet and send it to me

I miss your soup and I miss your bread
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when you dine

D-A-V-I-D

Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
Bloody your hands on a cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore"

Candidate,Candidate,David Bowie,"I'll make you a deal, like any other candidate
We'll pretend we're walking home 'cause your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like a street
There's a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the walls ""I smell the blood of Les Tricoteuses""
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
I'm having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumours and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you'd never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner that's selling papier-mâché
Making bullet-proof faces; Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
So you scream out of line:
""I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Any time?""
Tres butch little number whines ""Hey dirty, I want you
When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces""
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
Well, on the street where you live
I could not hold up my head
For I gave all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying 'til we break up our minds
'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands"

I'm guilty
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Remember when we used to go to church on sundays
I lay awake at night, terrified of school on mondays
Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

Pull the blinds and change their minds

Changes,Changes,David Bowie,"Oh yeah
Mmm

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

Oh yeah

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)

You've left us up to our necks in it

I feel a wreck without my little China Girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw the stars crashing

I'm a mess without my little China Girl
Wake up in the mornings, where's my little China Girl?
I hear her hearts beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down

I'm feeling tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl

I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head, plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little china girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

Oh baby, just you shut your mouth

Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
She says... shh

A charred faced man I spied
Blew into his handkerchief
And stuttered as he sighed:

Sell my house and furniture
To make this daydream mine""

Doo dah doo, doo dah

A crystal girl I spied
She kissed the blue bird's honey tongue

I see you see me standing on my own
Is it you that I'm walking through
Should I retrace my point of view
I'm left in clouded dreams of finding who
Not Columbine
Just incase you're my disguise
I found yourself to my surprise
I'm on the ground
And it's Harlequin who fix me up
Who catches you
Who wanishes me
From finding who
You are"
Come and Buy My Toys,Come and Buy My Toys,David Bowie,"Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red

Rich men's children running past
Their fathers dressed in hose
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
Gazing eyes and running wild
Past the stocks and over stiles
Kiss the window merry child
But come and buy my toys
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys
Leave the parsley on the stalls
Come and buy my toys
You shall own a cambric shirt
You shall work your father's land
But now you shall play in the market square
Till you'll be a man
Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red"
Conversation Piece,Conversation Piece,David Bowie,"I took this walk to ease my mind
To find out what's gnawing at me
Wouldn't think, to look at me
That I've spent a lot of time in education
It all seems so long ago
I'm a thinker, not a talker
I've no-one to talk to, anyway
I can't see the road
For the rain in my eyes
I live above the grocers' store
Owned by an Austrian
He often calls me down to eat
And he jokes about his broken English
Tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years of reading conversation
I stand without a word to say
I can't see the bridge
For the rain in my eyes
And the world is full of life
Full of folk who don't know me
And they walk in twos or threes or more
While the lamp that shines above the grocers' store
Investigates my face so rudely
And my essays lying scattered on the floor
Fulfil their needs just by being there
And my hands shake, my head hurts
My voice sticks inside my throat
I'm invisible and dumb
And no-one will recall me
And I can't see the water
For the tears in my eyes"
Cracked Actor,Cracked Actor,David Bowie,"I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff on my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty 'cause you just got paid

Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
Please stay

You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you, baby, you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex

Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead

Ooh, stay for a day
Ooh yeah
Don't you dare
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo!
Woo!

Criminal World,Criminal World,David Bowie,"You never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where that is at
I guess I recognise your destination
I think I see beneath your make-up
What you want is so separation
This is no ordinary, this is no ordinary

(Oh, oh, oh)
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys

You've got a very heavy reputation
But no-one knows about your low-life
I know a way to find a situation
And hold a candle to your high-life disguise
You caught me kneeling at your sister's door
That was no ordinary stick-up
I'm well aware just what you're looking for
I am no ordinary, I am no ordinary
(Oh, oh, oh)

Cygnet Committee,Cygnet Committee,David Bowie,"I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you
That sets the test

So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
""I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul
...dry
I crushed my heart
To ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare
What of me?
Who praised Their efforts
To be free?
Words of strength and care
And sympathy
I opened doors
That would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide
For little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you
That sets the test

So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word
""We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love
Will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
On slogans such as
""Wish You Could Hear
Love Is All We Need
Kick Out The Jams
Kick Out Your Mother
Cut Up Your Friend
Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End
And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
And We Can Force You to Be Free
And We Can Force You to Believe""
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
""I believe in the Power of Good
I Believe in the State of Love
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right""
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
On the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow
And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live

Live

Cynic,Cynic,David Bowie,"So pull me out of this dream
Turn off the television
Put on a romantic vinyl
And come to bed again
Please be my next morning flower
But don't be there all the time
Leave me a couple of hours
Then bring me food and wine

Play with me, play with me
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel
I'll make this week disappear
Like I've erased several months
It's turning into a year now
And I'm still a manikin
You're so poetic when you're sad
So tiring when you cry
We could fly out and get married
I think I love you now

Play with me, play with me
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel
Play with me, play with
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel"
C’est la vie,C'est la vie,David Bowie,"Through my window I can see
If the world is there for me
Will my shadow on the floor let me be?

And tomorrow calls my name
But I don't want to go
Through the burning flames of time

C'est la vie
C'est la vie

With my friends I play the tune
Warm and tired within my room
And the crackle of the fire whispered low

Now tomorrow takes my hand
But I don't want to go
Through the burning flames of time

C'est la vie
C'est la vie
How can I sail my good times
Over the waves of sorrow?
Show me tomorrow
Show me tomorrow
So that I will know

La la la la la la la

Now tomorrow takes my hand
But I don't want to go

Of lights and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit

Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart

I've got believers in me (I've got believers)

Hands upon the ghost
To the city of solid iron
Through the kingdom of the boats

Let him sail back home tonight

Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space
No-one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No-one here can beat you
Dancing out in space
Silent as Georges Rodenbach
Mist and silhouette
Girl, you move like water
You’ve got stars upon your head
You’ve got my name and number
You've got to take the floor

Dead Against It,Dead Against It,David Bowie,"And when she drowns
Within and in the fizzy gin, begins to sigh
""Good god"" or ""My"" I cry and die and lie beside
She is the apple in my eye
She talked to God
I couldn't cope
Or'd hope eloped
A dope, she roped
This salty lie
And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her
Telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it
And deep my wound
Within for every second chance it was
Thy-tore
From deep within, despite the rain, my words are worn
She loves to talk into the phone
No matter who
No matter when
No matter where
No better than the faulty line
And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her
Telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it"

Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise
As I walk down the aisle

And I'm gone, gone, gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly, fly, fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there

When silhouettes fall

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking

Three old men dancing under her lamp lights
Shaking their sex in the bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked, anew
Like a bad tempered child
On the rain slicked streets

And I'm gone, gone, gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly, fly, fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there

When silhouettes fall

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking

And I'm gone, gone, gone

Let me dance, dance, dance
And I'm gone
Let me dance, dance, dance

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking

Diamond Dogs,Diamond Dogs,David Bowie,"This ain't rock 'n' roll, this is genocide!

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Browning's Freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal

(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzan, go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed, Diamond Dogs are stabilised
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

(Oo-oo-ooh) call them the Diamond Dogs
(Oo-oo-ooh) call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh, hoo!
Ah ooh!

In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow

(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs

Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them, ooh hoo!

Did You Ever Have a Dream,Did You Ever Have a Dream,David Bowie,"Did you ever have a dream or two
Where the hero is a guy named you
And the things he does are just too much
Does he fly like Mr. Superman, speak Chinese, French and Dutch?
And did you ever have a dream or two?
Have you ever woken up one day
With the feeling that you'd been away?
If the girl that you dreamed of last night
Had the same dream, in the very same scene
With the very same boy, hold tight

It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can travel anywhere with anyone you care
It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can walk around in New York while you sleep in Penge
I will travel round the world one night
On the magic wings of astral flight
If you've got the secret, tell me do

I will travel round the world one night
On the magic wings of astral flight
If you've got the secret, tell me do
Have you ever had a dream or two?

Dirty Blvd.,Dirty Blvd.,David Bowie,"Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel
He looks out a window without glass
The walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
His father beats him 'cause he's too tired to beg
He's got 9 brothers and sisters
They're brought up on their knees
It's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs
Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
But that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard
He's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard
He's going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, to the dirty boulevard
This room cost 2,000 dollars a month
You can believe it man it's true
Somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants
No one here dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
They dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard
Give me your hungry, your tired your poor I'll piss on 'em
That's what the Statue of Bigotry says
Your poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death
And get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard
Get to end up, on the dirty boulevard
Going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, on the dirty boulevard
Going out
Outside it's a bright night
There's an opera at Lincoln Center
Movie stars arrive by limousine
The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan
But the lights are out on the Mean Streets
A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel
He's selling plastic roses for a buck
The traffic's backed up to 39th street
The TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck
And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming
He's found a book on magic in a garbage can
He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling
""At the count of 3"" he says, ""I hope I can disappear""
And fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly-fly-fly-fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly away
I want to fly
Fly, fly away
I want to fly
Fly-fly away (Fly a-)
Fly-fly-fly (-way, ooohhh...)
Fly-fly away (I want to fly-fly away)
Fly away (I want to fly, wow-woh, no, fly away)"
Dirty Boys,Dirty Boys,David Bowie,"Something like tobacco road
Living on a lonely road
I will pull you out of there
We will go to Finchley fair
I will buy you feather hat
I will steal a cricket bat
Smash some windows, make a noise
We will run with dirty boys

When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down and the die is cast
When the die is cast and you have no choice
We will run with dirty boys

We all gone mad
We all want you
Vinny and the boys, we all go through
You got to learn to hold your tongue
This ain't the moon this is burnin' sun

When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down and the die is cast
When the die is cast and you have no choice
We will run with dirty boys"
Dirty Song,Dirty Song,David Bowie,"If a womans hips are ample
Then I want her in the hay
Skirt and stocking all a rample
Cheerfully
For that's my way
If the woman bites in pleasure
Then I wipe it clean with hay
My mouth, her lap together
Thoroughly
For that's my way
If a woman goes on loving
When I feel too tired to play
I'd smile and go off waving, Amiably
For that's my way"
Dodo,Dodo,David Bowie,"Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design
He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time
He's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
He's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
She's quite enthralled with the childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure not a she
When lovers chose each other now the perk's are due
Another memo to screw
She's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
She's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
Can you wipe your nose my child without them spotting in your file a photograph
Can you sleep alone at night wake to find the scorching light of neighbor Jim
He's come to turn you in
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another do, do
Didn't hear it from me"

Say I'll be your man

Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I met this chick the other day
And then to me, she said she'll stay
I get this pad, just like a cave
And then we'll have our live-in maid
And then I'll lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round

Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I, I, I, I, I need a lover who's someone new
And then to her, I will be true

They're making sort of crazy sounds
Don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield

But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name

But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear

From New York to shanty town
There's always something else

No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake

Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh, Babe, it'll be alright (do-doo-ah)
Pour me out another phone (do-doo-ah)
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book, we can read up alone

And try to get it on like once before,
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw

His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday

Jung the foreman prayed at work (do-doo-ah)
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation
Amid this fall out saturation (do-doo-ah)
Cursing at the Astronette (do-doo-ah)
Who stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The bureau Supply for ageing men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Where once had raged the sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw

His name was always Buddy (do-doo-ah)
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid (do-doo-ah)
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him (do-doo-ah)

Eight Line Poem,Eight Line Poem,David Bowie,"The tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room

Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky"
Even a Fool Learns to Love,Even a Fool Learns to Love,David Bowie,"There was a time, the laughing time
I took my heart to every party
They'd point my way
""How are you today?""
""Will you make us laugh? Chase our blues away? ""
Their funny man won't let them down
No, he'd dance and prance and be their clown
That time, the laughing time
When even a fool learns to love
The clown turned around
And saw her smile, oh how she loved me
She'd clap her hands and beg me stay
To make her laugh, to make her life gay
Who wants the love of all the world
When here was love in the eyes of just one girl
That day, that precious day
When even a fool learns to love
But oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to loveThat day, that hateful day
The joke turned stale, the game was over
Those spiteful words ""Oh, go away. Who wants to play? ""
""It's getting late now.""
My world, my funny world
Had lost it's mask and shown a broken heart
A time, a sour time
When even a fool learns to love
But oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love"

Should turn to erosion
And we never get old

Dignity is valuable

And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose

But that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum

Five Years,Five Years,David Bowie,"Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in (cry in)
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying (dying)
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying (lying)
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat, skinny people
And all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the Black hadn't have pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milkshakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race
The way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful
I want you to walk
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got

Fly,Fly,David Bowie,"The television's on and I'm walking through the yard
The house is fast asleep and I'm crying in my car
Dying for the weekend

The kids are alright but they don't smile much
They sit up in their garage with their decks and their stuff
Dying for the weekend

The boy's on a charge but his mother doesn't know
I never got around yet to telling her so
It would only make her crazy

And I'll be fine
I'm only sleeping in my head
And I can fly
I close my eyes and I can fly

The television's on and I'm walking through the yard
The house is fast asleep and I'm crying in my car
Dying for the weekend
The kids have got a gig in an all night rave
They're lookin' pretty tough but I still want to say
Do you really have to go?

Down in the back street a skinny kid cries
Bad drive Saturday another life flies
Dying for the weekend

And I'll be fine
I'm only sleeping in my head
And I can fly
I close my eyes and I can fly
And I can fly
And fall toward the end
And I can fly
And I'll be fine
I'm only sleeping in my head
And I can fly
I close my eyes and I can fly"

Future Legend,Future Legend,David Bowie,"And in the death
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare
The shutters lifted an inch in temperance building, high on Poacher's Hill
And red mutant eyes gazed down on Hunger City
No more big wheels
Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
Any day now, the year of the Diamond Dogs
""This ain't rock and roll! This is genocide!"""

Too tense to be undone
I walk the streets
Not expecting morning sun
Against the voice of doom
Failures fall all over town

I guess I should
I feel I should

What happened when I wasn't around?
Who did what?
What went down?

It happens in the tunnel when I let myself feel

"Glass Spider, 2018","Glass Spider, 2018",David Bowie,"Up until one century ago there lived
In the Zi Duang province of an eastern country
A glass-like spider
Having devoured its prey
It would drape the skeletons over its web
In weeks creating a macabre shrine of remains
Its web was also unique, in that it had many layers
Like floors in a building
At the top of this palace-like place
Assembled with almost apparent care
Were tiny, shining objects
Glass, beads, dewdrops
One could almost call it an altar
When the breeze blew through this construction
It produced sounds of wailing, crying
Tiny wails, tiny cries
The baby spiders would get scared
And search frantically for their mother
But the glass spider would have long gone
Having known that the babies
Would survive somehow on their own
Oh, the glass spider had blue eyes almost like a human's
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries

Don't you hear this wasted cry, life is over you
(Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in Heaven, is there anyone in Hell?
(Gone, gone, the waters all gone)
(Mommy come back 'cause it's dark now)
(Oh-hoho-oh)
(Oh-hoho-oh)
Take care, take care
(Mommy come back  'cause the water's all gone)
Somewhere she glows divine, somewhere she wakes alone
But you, you've promised in your loving eye
God it's dark now
(Mommy come back 'cause it's dark now)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)

Gone, Gone the water's all gone
(Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
Stay low on the ground
The fire can drive you, savage and afraid
Spitting the dawn, come along before the animals awake
(Gone, gone, the water's all gone)
(Mommy come back 'cause it's dark now)
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left
If your mama don't love ya' then the riverbed might
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
(Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
Gone gone the water's all gone
Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Gone gone the water's all gone
Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Gone gone the water's all gone

God Knows I’m Good,God Knows I'm Good,David Bowie,"I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder

And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly
For her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling
Wooden floor
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way"
God Only Knows,God Only Knows,David Bowie,"If you should ever leave me
My life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me

But as long as there are
Stars above you
You'll never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

Growin’ Up,Growin' Up,David Bowie,"Well I stood stone like at midnight
Suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair 'til it was just right
And commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain
And I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone
Came out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd
But when they said sit down, I stood up
Ooh-ooh, growin' up
The flag of piracy flew from my mast
My sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate
She couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed the B-52 and bombed 'em with the blues
With my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school
Never once gave thought to landing, no
And I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd
When they said come down, I threw up
Ohh-oh, growin' up
I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere
You know it's really hard to hold your breath
And I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared
I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well my feet finally took root in the earth
But I got a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe
In the engine of an old parked car
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd
But when they said move down, I moved up
Oh-oh-oh, don't you know that I'm growin' up
I said, oh-oh-oh, I can't help it that I'm growin' up"

Hang on to Yourself,Hang on to Yourself,David Bowie,"Well, she's a tongue twisting storm
She'll come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on electric dreams

Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well, the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the Blessed, we're The Spiders From Mars

Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well come on

Come on

He Was Alright (A Song For Marc),He Was Alright (A Song For Marc),David Bowie,"People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight (second time: really quite paradise)
And he sang all night long
Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight (second time: really quite paradise)
And he sang all night long
Oh how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight (second time: really quite paradise)
And he sang all night long"
Heat,Heat,David Bowie,"When we saw Mishima's dog
Trapped between the rocks
Blocking the waterfall
The songs of dust
The world would end
The night was always falling
The peacock in the snow

And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison

I can only love you by hating him more
That's not the truth, it's too big a word
He believed that love is theft
Love and war, the theft of love

And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison
But I am a seer, I am a liar
I am a seer, but I am a liar

My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison"
Helden,Helden,David Bowie,"Du

Doch können wir siegen
Für immer und immer
Und wir sind dann Helden
Für einen Tag
Ich
Ich bin dann König
Und du
Du Königin
Obwohl sie
Unschlagbar scheinen
Werden wir Helden
Für einen Tag
Wir sind dann wir
An diesem Tag

Ich glaub' das zu träumen

Im Rücken war kalt
Schüsse reissen die luft
Doch wir küssen
Als ob nichts geschieht
Und die Scham fiel auf ihre Seite
Oh, wir können sie schlagen
Für alle Zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen Tag

Here Comes the Night,Here Comes the Night,David Bowie,"Ohhhhh... here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Oh, yeah (here comes the night)
I can see right out my window walking down the street my girl
With another guy
His arms around her
Like it used to be with me
Oh it makes me want to die

Yeah, here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Yeah... (here comes the night)

There they go, funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me
Why cannot I accept
The fact she's chosen him
And simply let them be?

Oh she is with him
They are turning down the lights
Now he is holding her the way I used to do
I can see her closing her eyes
And telling him lies
Exactly like she told me too"
Heroes,Heroes,David Bowie,"I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away

We can be heroes just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day

We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes

We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day"
Holy Holy,Holy Holy,David Bowie,"Listen Lady, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be lie-high-high-high-high-high, my! Oh my!
Slowly, we get too good and too holy
Helping one another, just a righteous brother
Night time, get me back in the night time
I don't want to be angel, just a little bit evil
I feel the devil in me
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
Let go of me
Listen Lady, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be a lie-high-high-high-high-high, my! Oh my!
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy

How Does the Grass Grow?,How Does the Grass Grow?,David Bowie,"There's a graveyard by the station where the girls
Wear vinyl skirts and sandals from Hungary
The boys ride their Riga 1s upon the little hills
Such sadness and grief, the kids die standing
That's where we made our tryst and struggled with our guns
Would you still love me if the clocks could go backwards?
The girls would fill with blood, and the grass will be green again
Remember the dead, they were so great, some of them

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Where do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood

Well I lived a blind life, a white face, a prison
That you made, a life out of nothing, now I ride by
Black roads. I miss you more than you'll never, ever know
Waiting with my red eyes and my stone heart

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Where do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood
I gaze in defeat at the stars in the night
The light in my life burnt away
There will be no tomorrow
Then you sigh in your sleep
And meaning returns with the day

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Where do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood"
How Lucky You Are,How Lucky You Are,David Bowie,"When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind in life
Shadows stalking, ever grasping sinking for a need
It wasn't love it was the fix of never wanting me
Now I'm gone, you're tossing and you turning in your sleep
That's the name of the game, of the game, of the game
Cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind
Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
Some days are heaven, I will not deny
Probing the daylight cascading the skyline
Tripping and diving and losing it all
Back came the night time living for more
Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now that I'm gone
I was the devil monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind
La La La La La"
Hurt,Hurt,David Bowie,"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear my crown of shit
On my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stain of time
The feeling disappears
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Night of the female good time drone

It is a hot certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down in my soul, baby
I cannot explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head, and I am feeling blue
Things you say well maybe they are true
I get funny dreams again and again
Knows what it means, but
Cannot explain
I think it is love
Say it to you
When I feel blue
I cannot explain, no, I cannot explain

You know I cannot explain
I am going out of my mind
Well I am  worried guy
But I cannot explain"
I Can’t Give Everything Away,I Can't Give Everything Away,David Bowie,"I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
The blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes

I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away

Seeing more and feeling less
Saying no but meaning yes
This is all I ever meant
That's the message that I sent

I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away

I don't care which shadow gets me
All I've got is someone's face

Can I see the family smile?
Can I reach tomorrow?
Can I walk a missing mile?
Can I feel?
Can I please?

I can't reach it anymore
I just sit back and ignore
I just can't seem to get it right, get it right
I can't reach it, I can't reach it"
I Dig Everything,I Dig Everything,David Bowie,"I've got the village I love
I walk along beside the garbagemen and I dig everything
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back
They don't dig anything
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't know a thing
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig
I feed the lions in Trafalgar Square and I dig everything
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes were low and dug
Everything
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything
I'd see people in the street below, who don't know where they're going
They don't dig anything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig
I've got more friends than I've had hot dinners
Some of them were losers, but the rest of them are winners
Rick, John, Sally, a connection named Paul
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything
Dig
I've made myself at home
I've made good friends which the time-check girl on the end of the phone
All the movie shows
I sunbathe for love
Even when it's not too hot
'Cause I dig everything
Oh yeah"

I feel free
I feel free

Dear when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free

I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
I feel free
I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
I feel free
Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me
I feel free
Dance floor is like the sea

We won't find out until we grow
Well I don't know if all that's true
Cause you got me, and baby I got you

Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe

They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a pot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe

I got flowers in the spring, I got you to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And if I get scared, you're always around
So let them say your hair's too long
Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb
Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe

I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you, I won't let go
I got you to love me so

I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe"

Parked under the stars
The winding stream
Moon shining down
On some little town
And with each beam
The same old dream

On a gemini spacecraft

I don't sit around and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand
I would give you all my love
Nothing else is free
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave"
If I’m Dreaming My Life,If I'm Dreaming My Life,David Bowie,"Was she never there?
Was she ever?
Was it air she breathed?
At the wrong time
All the flowers so
From the gallery
With the hymns of night
Singing: ""Come to me""

At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life

Just one living chance
When the mother sighs
When the father steps aside
At the wrong time
Oh-oh

At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life
Was she ever?
Was she ever here?
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life away

Dreaming my life

If You Can See Me,If You Can See Me,David Bowie,"If you can see me I can see you
I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroad, so take this knife
And meet me across the river
Just chutes and ladders
And this is the kiss
American anna fantasticalsation
From nowhere to nothing
And neither way back
Children swarm like thousands of bugs
Towards the light
The beacons above the hill
The stars to the West, the South, the North
And to the East
Now you can say I've got a gift of sorts
A fear of rear windows and swinging doors
My love of violence and tenants' sighs
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me I can see you
I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God
Swear to destroy the beast, stamping the ground
In their excitement for tomorrow
I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroad, so take this knife
And meet me across the river
I will take your lands and all that lays beneath
The dust of cold flowers, drizzle of dark ashes
I will slaughter your kind, descend from belief
I am the spirit of greed, the lord of theft
Burn all your books and the problems they make
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me"

It Ain’t Easy,It Ain't Easy,David Bowie,"When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

Well, all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants
You can give her something too

In that morning day
Been on that trip so many times
Good-God! was really yesterday
I've tried so many, many, many, many, many
Many ways
I've lied and taken off into the day
Leaving another girl to
Weep over the breakfast tray
Loved her before I knew her name
Hit me! Jack, 'cause I'm
Gone! love her way

Come back my brain
Feel holy again, I gave her
 oww, baby, baby
Gotta give her, oww, baby, baby

Can only destroy
I gave her, oww, baby, baby
Gettin' down, if I'm gonna be, the baby wants it
Gonna be me

There was no rein to check me
When all tho-ose little things walked on by
Oh! but I couldn't feel this, stammer out a word
When that angel stuck in my mind
Oo, oo, oo, oo
Lookin' for love won't hold me back
I'm gonna love her way

Come back my brain
Feel holy again
I gave her
Gotta give it, love
Oww, baby, baby
That kind of love
Can only destroy
I gave her, oww, baby, baby
Gotta get it now, If I'm
Gonna be her baby
It's gonna be me, yeah

Let's play, not play this record
Waitin' for the telephone to ring
Wiped-out and bitter, with a
Bag clutched in her hand
All the cars sound like they're
Pulling in the drive
Umm, no, no, no, no, no, uhh
I see her now
A little tear running down her check
Laugh! Let down
People looking for me

I want to race down her street
And knock hard, hard, hard on the door 'til
Until she breaks down in my arms like a
*Tracy tie*, yell ""I feel the pain"" {?
I'll be so strong again and again

Come back my brain, yeah
I'm holy again
I'll take ya, oww, babe, baby, baby
We're gonna have, oww, baby, baby

Can only bring you joy
I'm gonna, oww, baby

Give you, baby, baby

It’s Hard to Be a Saint in the City,It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City,David Bowie,"I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra
I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova
I could walk like Brando right into the sun and dance just like a Casanova
With my blackjack and jacket and my hair slicked sweet
Silver studs on my duds just like a Harley in heat
When I strut down the street I could hear its heartbeat
The sisters fell back and said, ""Don't that man look pretty""
The cripple on the corner cried out, ""Penny, nickels for your pity""
Them gasoline boys downtown, they sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city
I was a king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash
I was a prince of the paupers, crowned downtown at the Beggars' Bash
I was a pimp's main prophet, I kept everything cool
Just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground, mama
Devil appeared to me like Jesus through the steam in the street
And showed me a hand that even the cops couldn't beat
And I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat
It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy out on the street
And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
As the tracks clack out the rhythm, the eyes fixed straight ahead
They ride the line of balancing, hold on by just a thread
Well, it's too hot in these tunnels, you can get hit up by the heat
When you get up to get out at your next stop, but they push you back down in your seat
And your heart starts beating faster as you struggle to your feet
Then you're out of that hole, back on the street
And them southside sisters, they sure look pretty
And the cripple on the corner cries out, ""Nickels for your pity""
And them downtown boys, they sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city"

Brilliant and naked just
The way that authors look
Clare and Lady Manners drink
Until the other cows go home
Gossip till their lips are bleeding
Politics and all

I’d rather be flying
I’d rather be dead
Or out of my head
Than training these guns on those men in the sand
I’d rather be high

The Thames was black, the tower dark
I flew to Cairo, find my regiment
City’s full of generals
And generals full of shit
I stumble to the graveyard and I
Lay down by my parents, whisper
Just remember duckies
Everybody gets got

Or out of my head
Than training these guns on those men in the sand

Hold my hand and
I’ll take you there
Who will I become
In the USA?
Hold my hand and
I’ll take you there

Sophie and Lev are running away
These are the days
The days of gloom
Lev can’t smile and Sophie can’t sing
A mile to the future
Where tomorrow is king

Know where you are
Only that you are
Safe in this world
Then I’ll be content
Get on with my life
Eat, drink and sleep
Look up at the stars"

For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown

At least you're in

Next month we shall find a place where prices ain't so stiff
15 bob a go, afraid that's past a joke

And every spurned heart makes its plan

And I know that if there's a God above
Through million times we'll remember
How the trail slips away

His beads are all he owns

Slow down
Slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Fairy tale skin
Depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war
A gentle face you've seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side
The wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been
I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in
But
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin

Slow down
Slow down

Killing a Little Time,Killing a Little Time,David Bowie,"I staggered through this criminal reign
I'm not in love, no phony pain
Creeping through this tidal wave
No warm embrace, just a lover's grave
This symphony
This rage in me
I've got a handful of songs to sing
To sting your soul
To fuck you over
This furious reign

I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
I'm the broken line
I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
Just killing a little time

I love the sound of an empty room
The screams of night, the end of love
Two beating hearts, one labored start
One open wound, wasted and drawn
No sympathy
This furious reign
I lay in bed
The monster fed, the body bled
I turned and said
""I get some of you all the time
All of you some other time""
This rage in me
Get away from me
I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
I'm the broken line
I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
Just killing a little time

This symphony
Get away from me"
Kingdom Come,Kingdom Come,David Bowie,"Well, I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries ""It's all in vain""
The voice of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Oh Lord, I just need one day

Well, I've been breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes, I've been breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay?

Well, the river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just a slave of a burning ray
Oh, give me the night, I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night

Been breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes, I've been breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay?
Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me, hoping I'm going to die

(I won't be breaking no rocks)
I won't be breaking no rocks
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
I said I won't be breaking no rocks
(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh
Who will pardon me?

Remember how they messed up this old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching other people's dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire and take the car downtown

Silver and Americard
She'll drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta

And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end

She'll come, she'll go
She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view

And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress

Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace

And he was alright
The band was altogether
Yes, he was alright
The song went on forever
Yes, he was awful nice
Really quite outta sight
And he sang all night long

Femme fatales emerged from shadows to watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs to make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady Stardust sang his songs of darkness and dismay

And he was alright
The band was altogether
Yes, he was alright
The song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite paradise, and he sang
All night, all night long
Ooh, how I sighed
When they asked if I knew his name

Oh, it was alright

Yes, he was alright
And the song went on forever
He was awful nice
Really quite paradise, he sang

Look up here, man, I'm in danger
I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so high, it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below
Ain't that just like me?

By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
There I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass

Because the years of fretting days is right behind you now
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds

I will show you a game where the winner never wins

Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free

I will hold a lighted lamp and we shall walk together

Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you?

I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'd like to hear

Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Let me sleep beside you"

"Letter to American Fan, 1967","Letter to American Fan, 1967",David Bowie,"PITT
25th., September 1967
Dear Sandra,
When I called in this, my manager's office, a few moments ago I was handed my very first American fan letter - and it was from you. I was so pleased that I had to sit down and type an immediate reply, even though Ken is shouting at me to get on with a script he badly needs. That can wiat (wi-at? That's a new English word which means wait).
I've been waiting for some reaction to the album from American listeners. There were reviews in Billboard and Cash Box, but they were by professional critics and they rarely reflect the opinions of the public. The critics were very flattering however. They even liked the single ""Love You Till Tuesday"". I've got a copy of the American album and they've printed the picture a little yellow. I'm really not that blond. I think the picture on the back is more 'me'. Hope you like those enclosed.
In answer to your questions, my real name is David Jones and I don't have to tell you why I changed it. ""Nobody's going to make a monkey out of you"" said my manager. My birthday is January 8th and I guess I'm 5'10"". There is a Fan Club here in England, but if things go well in the States then we'll have one there I suppose. It's a little early to even think about it.
I hope one day to get to America. My manager tells me lots about it as he has been there many times with other acts he manages. I was watching an old film on TV the other night called ""No Down Payment"" a great film, but rather depressing if it is a true reflection of The American Way Of Life. However, shortly after that they showed a documentary about Robert Frost the American poet, filmed mainly at his home in Vermont, and that evened the score. I am sure that that is nearer the real America. I made my first movie last week. Just a fifteen minutes short, but it gave me some good experience for a full length deal I have starting in January.
Thankyou for being so kind as to write to me and do please write again and let me know some more about yourself.
Yours sincerely,
David Bowie"

I could squeeze her grabby hand
Knowing that I never paid her for a gram
She's a drunken doxy off her trolly
Sent before her time into this poxy world
She's not fit for anything but dealing it

Sunshine entered our Frankie's days
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coin he made
Then two gentlemen called on him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?
Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before

London Boys,London Boys,David Bowie,"Bow Bells strike another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away
Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you
Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys
You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys
A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You're crying out loud that you're a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, cause you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys"

Look Back in Anger,Look Back in Anger,David Bowie,"""You know who I am,"" he said
The speaker was an angel
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
""It's time we should be going""

(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, driven by the night
Til you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, see it in my eyes
Til you come

No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me

(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, driven by the night
Til you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, feel it in my voice
Til you come

Love Is Lost,Love Is Lost,David Bowie,"It's the darkest hour, you're twenty-two
The voice of youth, the hour of dread
It's the darkest hour, and your voice is new
Love is lost, lost is love

Your country's new, your friends are new
Your house, and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new, and your accent, too
But your fear is as old as the world
Say goodbye to the thrills of life
When love was good, no love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello, you're a beautiful girl

Say hello to the lunatic men
Tell them your secrets, they're like the grave
Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?
Love is lost, lost is love
You know so much, it’s making you cry
You refuse to talk, but you think like mad
You've cut out your soul and the face of thought
Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?
Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?"

You know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen?
You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But there's no other way
So now it's really up to you

Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn

Love You Till Tuesday,Love You Till Tuesday,David Bowie,"Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you'll walk out through your door I'll wave my flag and shout

Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday

Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool

Oh, beatiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always watch you until my love runs dry

Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's a flame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday

Well, I might stretch it till Wednesday"
Lover To The Dawn,Lover To The Dawn,David Bowie,"And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The thinker sits alone, growing older
And so bitter
She gave them life
She gave them all
They drained her very soul dry
Dry, dry

Hey hey hey, bitter girl
We're out to sitting here digging you
We flew done here just to figure you
It's easy
Don't be so bitter
Oh oh oh, crazy girl
You gave too much and you got nothing
Too many problems and not one thing
In return
Left high and dry, oh

And as the sun rise stream
Flickers on
She finds lavender
To hide the beckoning of hatred
Oh, what rise, baby skin
Throws back her head to scream her sides
The woodland shades its eyes
To such a strange event
Hey hey hey, bitter girl
We're not just sitting here digging you
We flew done here just to figure you
It's tragic
You seem to lose
Oh oh oh, crazy girl
Don't throw your heart to the prowling moon
Don't wait too long for the prowling moon
Why do you stay here for so long

Here comes the David in your eyes
To the sun, to the sun
Here comes the David in your eyes
To the sun, to the sun
Here comes the David in your eyes
To the sun, to the sun"
Loving the Alien,Loving the Alien,David Bowie,"Watching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
They're travelling the holy land
Opening telegrams
Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeur de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind

But if you pray
All your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear

Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers, they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)


Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan
Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail
But if you pray
All your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear

Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers, they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

You pray til the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And you’ll believe you’re loving the alien

Can do

So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric
Goes wrong
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern
Song

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she
Knows what the noise
Can do
Or this shallow orb mugged by reality
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need
You
Live and you die in the blink of an eye
Still I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise

Knows what the noise
Can do"

Maid of Bond Street,Maid of Bond Street,David Bowie,"This girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the pictures of herself
Every magazine on every shelf

This girl is maid of Bond Street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs

This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her

This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy that she once knew
Doesn't want to know her any more

And this girl is a lonely girl
Every thing she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time
This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesn't have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs"
Memory of a Free Festival,Memory of a Free Festival,David Bowie,"""Maybe I should announce it, should I?
Memory of a free festival.""

The Children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

Touch, We touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the topest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes
And saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party

Move On,Move On,David Bowie,"Sometimes I feel the need to move on
So I pack a bag and move on
Move on
Well, I might take a train or sail at dawn
Might take a girl when I move on
When I move on

Somewhere, someone is calling me
When the chips are down
I am just a travelling man
Maybe it is just a trick of the mind
But somewhere there is a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere there's an ocean
Innocent and wild

Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground
Cyprus is my island
When the going's rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that
Mahi-ya, mahi-yo, mahi-ya, mahi-yo
Mahi-ya, mahi-yo, mahi-ya, mahi-yo

Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
I can't forget you, can't forget you
Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
I can't forget you, can't forget you

I can't forget you, can't forget you"
Much Too Much,Much Too Much,David Bowie,"Much too much to bear

Your love is hard and fast
Your love will always last
If it's you I need
I've got to pay the levy
Got to pay
Because your love's too heavy on me

And it's much too much to bear

If I ever leave you darling
I hope you see
That I really love you
But your love's too heavy on me


When I make love to you
Do all the things you want me to do
You never think of me
Always cry a bevy
Bevy of tears
Because your love's too heavy on me

There was a time I could give all I had to you
But my enthusiasm waned and I can't bear the pain
Of doing what I don't want to do


Your love is hard and fast
Your love will always last
If it's you I need
I've got to pay the levy
Got to pay
Because your love's too heavy on me"
Nature Boy,Nature Boy,David Bowie,"This story is about love
The woman I loved is... dead

There was a boy
A very strange, enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far
Very far, over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
One magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me:
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"""
Neighborhood Threat,Neighborhood Threat,David Bowie,"Down where your paint is cracking
Look down your backstairs buddy
Somebody's living there and
He don't really feel the weather
And he don't share your pleasures
No he don't share your pleasures

Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he don't run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash

You can't help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat
Somewhere a baby's bleeding
Somewhere a mother's needing
Outside a boy is lying
But mostly he is crying
And he just shouts in anger
You'll find him interesting
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he doesn't build for you
Everybody always wants to run with you"
Never Get Old,Never Get Old,David Bowie,"Better take care
Think I better go, better get a room
Better take care of me
Again and again
I think about this and I think about personal history
Better take care
I breathe so deep when the movie gets real
When the star turns round
Again and again
He looks me in the eye says he's got his mind on a countdown
3-2-1

Forever
I'm screaming that I'm gonna be living on till the end of time
Forever
The sky splits open to a dull red skull
My head hangs low 'cause it's all over now

And there's never gonna be enough money
And there's never gonna be enough drugs
And I'm never ever gonna get old
There's never gonna be enough bullets
There's never gonna be enough sex
And I'm never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
And I'm never ever gonna get low
And I'm never ever gonna get old
Better take care
The moon flows on to the edges of the world because of you
Again and again
And I'm awake in an age of light living it because of you
Better take care
I'm looking at the future solid as a rock because of you
Again and again
Want to be here and I wanna be there
Living just like you, living just like me

Forever
Putting on my gloves and bury my bones in the marshland
Forever
Think about my soul but I don't need a thing just the ring of the bell in the pure clean air

And I'm running down the street of life
And I'm never gonna let you die
And I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get
And I'm never ever gonna get old
I'm never ever gonna get
Never ever get old"
Never Let Me Down,Never Let Me Down,David Bowie,"When I believed in nothing
I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint
In some place
I called her name
And though my days were slipping by
And nights so cruel
I thought I'd die

She danced her little dance 'til it made me cry
She was shaking like this honey doing that

When I needed soul revival
I called your name
When I was falling to pieces
I screamed in pain
Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real
Swept over me

You danced a little dance 'til it made me cry
She was shaking like this honey doing that
Never let me down
She never let me down
Never let me down
She never let me down

When all your faith is failing, call my name
When you've got nothing coming, call my name
I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head
Until the bad stuff breaks

Dance my little dance 'til it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that

Never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

Oh no"

Hey

Do you see that thing (that thing)
I'm sure it's love (it's love)
Would you do one thing
New York's in love
The city grew wings
In the back of the night
The clouds are stuck
Like candy-floss
She sees the rich trash
Having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get the energy from
There's nothing you can do to her
This city's all clean and waiting
I don't mean to wait too long
But this joint can't get much higher

New York's in love
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames
New York's in love
With the way she talks (t-t-talks, t-t-talks)
And the way she walks
New York's in love
Goo goo goo goo goo goo
My, oh my, it's a tom-tom beat
No-one knows they've had their day
We can dance and we can see the singles swing
Everybody's waiting for the Go-Go Boys
You're turned to stone by the family
It's now the dead speak to the living
Nothing left here
But a raging blaze
I don't mean to wait too long

New York's in love
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames
New York's in love
With the way she talks
And the way she walks (walk that walk)

Ugly on each side

The moving has come through
The danger brushing you
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels
It's so cold
The dark dug up by dogs
The stiches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke
Has hit the bloodlite

Glass traps open and close on
Nite flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall

The darkest shore wouldn't bother me
If I can't control
The web we weave
My life will be lost in falling leaves

Every single move's uncertain
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
You've got to have a scheme
You've got to have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man
No control
Stay away from the future
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

Forbidden words, deafen me
In memory, no control
See how far a sinful man
Burn his tracks, his bloody robes

You've got to have a scheme
You've got to have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man
I should live my life on bended knee

Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh, you Pretty Things

Oh, you Pretty Things

You gotta make way for the Homo Superior
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself, they belong to you
They're the start of the coming race
The earth is a bitch, we've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use

I know all the best ways to break out of here
I helped a young laddie called Ivan
I bundled him over the wall last night
Then he climbed back and he grabbed me tight
He uttered some words that I can't say to you
'Cause he remembered that he was a screw

I've spent half me life in and out of nick

I sussed all them files, I'm a clever young man
Now I'm just stupid with manicured hands

We tried digging tunnels but gave up the ghost just past the Kensington yards at the most
Our limbs was aching, we felt pretty pooped
Our clothes they was tatty, our arrows did droop
We crawled back to safety, our hearts filled with gloom
'Cos we'd dug ourselves through to the smallest room

Drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion
Such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang

Panic in Detroit
I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home
I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens
That broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive

Panic in Detroit
I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home
I wish someone would phone

Putting on some clothes, I made my way to school
And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights
{Verse 3}
Having scored a trillion dollars
Made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table
A gun and me alone
I ran to the window, looked for a plane or two

To give all the love that he can
I pray my wish will come true
For my child and your child too
He'll see the day of glory
See the day when men of good will
Live in peace, live in peace again
Peace on earth, can it be
Can it be
Bing: it's a pretty theme, isn't it?"

Pain that comes and goes
It goes against all you see
You see I got gables eyes
And eisenhower blames the poor

Gotta get back in shape

Please Mr. Gravedigger,Please Mr. Gravedigger,David Bowie,"There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers, all that jazz
Till the war come along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot

And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
""Ah-choo, excuse me""

Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
And you put it in your pocket
""God, it's pouring down""

Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Say ""ah-choo!""
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10 and full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, oh God

No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes my friend
And this one here's for you
""Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, (crikey) catch pneumonia or something in this rain..."""
Port of Amsterdam,Port of Amsterdam,David Bowie,"In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light
In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon
And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
""Hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly
In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamps
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
Well he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
And he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam"

So I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart, walk out of her mind
Oh, not her

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it then she can do it
She don't make false claims
But she's a Queen and such are queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
Yes, she's leading him on

And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh, the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah, I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
And he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all

It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say
Why didn't I say, no, no, no

Quicksand,Quicksand,David Bowie,"I'm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform
Of imagery
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm
Of dream reality
I'm frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power anymore
No I ain't got the power anymore

I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies
I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets
Divine symmetry
Should I kiss the viper's fang
Or herald loud the death of Man
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah!
Ah!

I'm not a prophet or a stone age man
Just a mortal with potential of a superman
I'm living on
I'm tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith
If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it
On the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself

Un pensiero uno solo
Io cammino mentre dorme la città
I suoi occhi nella notte
Fanali bianchi nella notte
Una voce che mi parla chi sarà?
Dimmi ragazzo solo dove vai
Perché tanto dolore?
Hai perduto senza dubbio un grande amore
Ma di amori è tutta piena la città
No ragazza sola, no no no
Stavolta sei in errore
Non ho perso solamente un grande amore
Ieri sera ho perso tutto con lei
Ma lei
I colori della vita
Dei cieli blu
Una come lei non la troverò mai più
Ora ragazzo solo dove andrai
La notte è un grande mare
Se ti serve la mia mano per nuotare
Grazie ma stasera io vorrei morire
Perché sai negli occhi miei
C'è un angelo, un angelo
Che ormai non vola più che ormai non vola più
Che ormai non vola più
C'è lei
I colori della vita
Dei cieli blu
Una come lei non la troverò
Mai più"

The face of seduction was you
But I listened for each and every footstep
In this Real Cool World

Questioning saintlike and fantastic heroes
Feeling like lost little children in fabled lands
So I listen for each and every friendship
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Starry-eyed life but somehow believing in nothing
You whisper sweet nothing but reading between your lines
I listen color me doubtful

The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans
Bearing arms and flaunting all her mischief

And I swear

I built a wall of sound to separate us
And hid among the junk of wretched highs
I sped from Planet X to Planet Alpha
Struggling for reality

Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo

Whoo hoo

Hey, now my sight is failing in this twilight
Da da da da da da da da da
Now my death is more than just a sad song
Da da da da da da da da da

Never looked over reality's shoulder

Remembering Marie A.,Remembering Marie A.,David Bowie,"It was a day in that blue month September
Silent beneath the plum trees' slender shade
I held her there
My love, so pale and silent
As if she were a dream that must not fade
Above us in the shining summer heaven
There was a cloud my eyes dwelled long upon
It was quite white and very high above us
Then I looked up
And found that it had gone
And since that day, so many moons in silence
Have swum across the sky and gone below
The plum trees surely have been chopped for firewood
And if you ask, how does that love seem now
I must admit, I really can't remember
And yet I know what you are trying to say
But what her face was like, I know no longer
I only know I kissed it on that day
As for the kiss, I long ago forgot it
But for the cloud that floated in the sky
I know that still and shall forever know it
It was quite white and moved in very high
It may be that the plum trees still are blooming
That woman's seventh child may now be there
And yet that cloud had only bloomed for minutes
When I looked up
It vanished on the air"
Repetition,Repetition,David Bowie,"Johnny is a man and he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through you
When you ask him how the kids are
He'll get home around seven

And he could have had a Cadillac
If the school had taught him right

And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

And the food is on the table but the food is cold
(Don't hit her)
Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook?
Well, Johnny is a man and he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through

And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
It shows through
It shows through
It shows through"

You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no, love! You're not alone

Yeah, we kept on rocking
Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down
About twelve o'clock
When the place was packed
The front doors were locked
I said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back
But kept on rocking
Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down
Yeah
About twelve o'clock
Around lock up time
Well, the doors were locked
Said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back

Going round 'n' round

Rubber Band,Rubber Band,David Bowie,"Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand
Rubber Band
In 1910, I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes
Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune
Oh
Rubber Band
Won't you play a haunting theme again to me
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea?
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon
(Oh, play that theme)
Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in lively parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love
Rubber Band
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of your band, oh
Oh yeah
I hope you break your baton"
Running Gun Blues,Running Gun Blues,David Bowie,"I count the corpses on my left, I find I'm not so tidy
So I better get away, better make it today
I've cut twenty-three down since Friday
But I can't control it
My face is drawn, my instinct still emotes it

I slashed them cold, I killed them dead
I broke the gooks, I cracked their heads
I'll bomb them out from under the beds
But now I've got the running gun blues

It seems the peacefuls stopped the war
Left generals squashed and stifled
But I'll slip out again tonight
'Cause they haven't taken back my rifle
For I promote oblivion
And I'll plug a few civilians

I'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead
I'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads
I'll slice them till they're running red
But now I've got the running gun blues"

But thin is thin and chances slim
And sometimes we all have those dreams
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

All we needed, all we wished for

Saviour Machine,Saviour Machine,David Bowie,"President Joe once had a dream
The world held his hand, gave their pledge
So he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine
They called it the Prayer, its answer was law
Its logic stopped war, gave them food
How they adored till it cried in its boredom
""Please don't believe in me
Please disagree with me
Life is too easy
A plague seems quite feasible now
Or maybe a war
Or I may kill you all""

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

I need you flying, and I'll show that dying
Is living beyond reason, sacred dimension of time
I perceive every sign, I can steal every mind

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine"

When I looked in her eyes, they were blue but nobody home

And she do
She opened strange doors that we'd never close again

She began to wail jealousy's scream
Waiting at the lights, know what I mean

Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well, I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies

She wails Jimmy's guitar sound, jealousy's scream
Waiting at the lights, know what I mean

Scream Like a Baby,Scream Like a Baby,David Bowie,"Well, I wouldn't buy no merchandise
And I wouldn't go to war
And I mixed with other colours
But the nurse doesn't care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day
But I remember Sam
'Cause he was like me

Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

Well, they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And, oh, I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now I'm learning to be a part of societ... societ... s...
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

No athletic program
No discipline, no book
He just sat in the backseat
Swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved

Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun"

Gazing at trees in sorrow hardly a sound 'til tomorrow

Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever

He's a broken man
I'm also a broken man
It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric
Some of the houses around here
Still have inhabitants in them
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not
I don't get to speak much to anyone
Or that sort of thing

If I want to sometimes ... and I ask
I can still hear some pop...popular musics and aftershocks. (Ahhh-choo)

A city full of flowers

I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
I don't regret anything at all
I remember how we wept

On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry

I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Hold my face before you
Still my trembling heart

Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

The gods forgot they made me
So I forgot them too
I listen to the shadows
I play among their graves

My heart was never broken
My patience never tried

I got seven days to live my life

Seven days to live my life

And there's a girl
Up ahead who says she knows

And the street overflows
With the folk who understand
For the guy who can't be seen
He's the Shadow Man
And the Shadow Man is close at hand

Take a turn and see his smile
Made of nothing but loneliness
Take a walk and be a friend
To the Shadow Man

You can call him Joe, you can call him Sam
You should call and see who answers
For he promises to come running, guided by the truth
For the Shadow Man is really you

Look in his eyes and see your reflection
Look to the stars and see his eyes
He'll show you tomorrow, he'll show you the sorrow
Of what you did today
You can call him foe, you can call him friend
You should call and see who answers
For he knows your eyes are drawn to the road ahead
And the Shadow Man is waiting round the bend
The Shadow Man is waiting up ahead

When time and tide have been
Boy into your passing hands

Do not make them desert sands

I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father, she caved my head
Oh Lord, the things she said
My God, she should be told
I was very smart
Broke the gentle hearts
Of many young virgins
I was quick on the ball
Left them so lonely
They'd just give up trying
Then she took my head and
Smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly
Kept me going around
So she don't know I crave her so-o-o
I'll give my love in vain
To reach that peak again

Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls

You can see her ghost but that's a lie because the naughty woman isn't dead

Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
Called herself Eileen
Came to London town

Shopping For Girls (ChangesNowBowie Version),Shopping For Girls (ChangesNowBowie Version),David Bowie,"Dead ring ash of extreme defense
The lonely groups of company boys
Snapping pics of scrawny limbs?and?toothy grins
These are?children riding naked on their tourist?pals
While the hollows that pass for eyes swell from withdrawal
As he lies on a mattress in a rat-infested room
Talking 'bout his family and the cold back home

Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers, pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls

A small black someone jumps over the crazy white guard
Cranking up the volume on a Michael Jackson song

Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers, pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls

Where the frangipani scents the air
She mouths a word that breaks his stare
He grunts his reply in a garrulous croak
""That's a mighty big word for a nine year old""
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers, pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls

He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls
You gaze down into her eyes for a million miles
You wanna give her a name and a clean rag doll"

Something in the Air,Something in the Air,David Bowie,"Your coat and hat are gone
I really can't look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Don't look me in the eye
We lay in each others arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we lived it out, something in the air
We smiled too fast then can't think of a thing to say

Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Nothing left to say
Let's take what we can
I know you hold your head up high
We've raced for the last time
A place of no return

And there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
Something in the air
Something in my eye
Abracadoo - I lose you
We can't avoid the clash, the big mistake
Now we're going to pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Can't believe I'm asking you to go
We used what we could to get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted
Anyone more than you

Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Say what you will
But there's something in the air
Raced for the last time
Well I know you hold your head up high
There's nothing we have to say, there's nothing in my eyes

But there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
There's something I have to say
There's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long"
Song for Bob Dylan,Song for Bob Dylan,David Bowie,"Oh, hear this Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
His words of truthful vengeance
They could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more

Ah, here she comes, here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

You gave your heart to every bedsit room
At least a picture on my wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
The paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising, we'd rather be scared
Together than alone
Ah, here she comes, here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
{Instrumental Bridge}

Now hear this Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he'd gaze a while down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So we're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
And give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity

Ah, here she comes, here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Ah, a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Oh, here she comes, ooh, here she comes
Oh, here she comes, ooh

Stand on platforms blank looks and notebooks
Sit in the back rows of city limits
Lay in bed coming and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms like a cell's dimension
Rise for a year or two then make war
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done

Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
I can't stand another sound

Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
They pick up in bars and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once but dream and dream
They don't walk, they just glide in and out of life
They never die, they just go to sleep one day

Soul Love,Soul Love,David Bowie,"Stone love - she kneels before the grave
A brave son - who gave his life
To save the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning

Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving


Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness
Evolves, by the blindness that surrounds him
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving"

Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head

Here are we, one magical moment
Such is the stuff, from where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean
Lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no color
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are you, drive like a demon
From station to station

The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains

And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh, what will I be believing
And who will connect me with love?
Wonder who, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high

It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love

It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again

I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful

Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me

This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

Heart wrecker, heart wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay - that's what I meant to say

No trendy réchauffé

All my violence raining tears upon the sheets
I'm bewildered, for we're strangers when we meet

Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you
Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes
All my violence raging tears upon the sheets
I'm resentful, for we're strangers when we meet

Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new
Your embrace
It was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu

Steely resolve is falling from me
My poor soul, poor bruised passivity
All your regrets ran rough-shod over me
I'm so glad that we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful, that we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover, for we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over, but we're strangers when we meet

I've got ninety-nine years of laying in the dark and I'm far too young to lie
I've got ninety-nine ways to play my guitar it's going to pay me before I die
So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
I'm just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam! and Kapow!
With my guitar and me soprano
We can give you sweet head
I'm tough as glass and clean as night
Well if looks can love we can love all right
I'm your rubber peacock angelic whore
I'm a wrought iron face upon the wall
I had ninety-nine years of murder come life and I'm running away from it all
I got a bedroom, every mirror in town they're going to claim me if I fall
So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
I'm just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam! and Kapow!
With my guitar and me soprano
We can give you sweet head
Sweet head, give you sweet head
(spoken: while ya down there)
See my eyes of blocked emotion, see my tremble, see my fall
Traumatics thick and fast, your faith in me can last
Besides I'm known to lay you, one and all
Look south the way your mother dwells
If she knew what's going down, she'd give you hell
I'm the kind of man she warned me of
Till there was rock, you only had god
You and I have a mutual vow
We both like young, and we both like loud
I got pretty shoes, and I'm kid and proud
I'm street side out with my ear to the crowd
So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
I'm just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam! and Kapow!
With my guitar and me soprano
We can give you sweet head
Move along, sir!"

I'm in a rock'n'roll band. Huh!

Oh, all the poet, they studied rules of verse
And the ladies, they rolled their eyes
Sweet Jane! Whoa! Sweet Jane, oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!
I'll tell you something
Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, she is a clerk

Some people, they like to go out dancing
And other peoples, they have to work. Just watch me now!
And there's even some evil mothers
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
Y'know that, women, never really faint
And that villains always blink their eyes, woo!
And that, y'know, children are the only ones who blush!
And that, life is, just to die!
And, everyone who ever had a heart, oh
That wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part, whoa

Sweet Thing,Sweet Thing,David Bowie,"It's safe in the city
To love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isn't it me
Putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the centre of things
Where the knowing one says:

""Boys, Boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, Boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
For hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing""

I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads of Hamburgers, and
""Boys, Boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, Boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing

Teenage Wildlife,Teenage Wildlife,David Bowie,"Well, how come you only want tomorrow?
With its promise of something hard to do
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above and sun on your arms
Strength in your stride and hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire - I guess the season is on

So you train by shadow boxing, search for the truth
But it's all, but it's all used up
Break open your million dollar weapon
And you push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck
A broken nosed mogul, are you one of the New Wave boys?

Same old thing in brand new drag
Comes sweeping into view, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
As ugly as a teenage millionaire
Pretending it's a whizz kid world
You'll take me aside, and say
""Well, David, what shall I do? They wait for me in the hallway""
I'll say ""Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways""
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
I feel like a group of one, no-no
They can't do this to me
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife

Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
And the word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
And you're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind

You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No, no

I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife
I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife

And no one will have seen and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove that you couldn't pass the test
There'll be others on the line filing past
Who'll whisper low I miss you he really had to go
Well, each to his own, he was another piece of teenage wildlife
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Another piece of teenage wild... life
Wild...
Wild... life"

That’s Motivation,That's Motivation,David Bowie,"Do you hear what I hear?
Do you see what I see?
Colin, I want you to use your imagination
You wake up one morning and you ask yourself
Why am I so exciting?
What makes me dramatic?
You're trying to say something about yourself
The dazzling crime of wisdom
You fall for reality
You're bruised and bewildered
Then you learn to fall in love with yourself
That's motivation
You raise yourself high
Presenting your soul
You step from the shadows
You hear the command
An image to dream
You tremble permission
Tomorrow's rewards bloody skies of today
You'll step out of time
Into life's every dream
A life of such powerful meaning
Now you has class
Now you has splash
Now you has mass motivation
Here's an image I can recommend
Here's a product you will die for
Here's a nightmare that will never end
Get you fired up burning go oh oh
You know you got something
You know you got style
We don't take much just a little bit
That's motivation
Welcome to the world of your dreams, Colin
Where you can be what you want
Commit horrible sins
And get away with it
Lust
Gluttony
Pride
Anger
Sloth
Avarice
And jealousy
You know you got something
You know you got the style
We don't take much, but a little bit
That's motivation
No more false illusion
Goodbye to confusion
Stand out from the madding crowd
Motivation is symphony
Symphony in style (that's motivation)
It's brilliant, original (that's motivation)
Stimulating, encouragement (that's motivation)
As precious from home (that's motivation)

Say what (motivation)

That you want me

That you want me

Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way

Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

I thought my day would come
When I would be
The only one
I thought my day would come
Under the moon
And under the sun
Now I shout through all the streets today
Lucky me your love has come my way
Now tell me I was a fool
Up where the moon is shining so brightly
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

I believe that dreams come true
I believe, because of you
He who made the stars in sky
Made the world for you and I

I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time i tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time

That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright

The Ballad of the Adventurers,The Ballad of the Adventurers,David Bowie,"Sickened by sun, with rainstorms lashing him rotten
A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair
Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten
Gone the roof overhead, but the sky was always there
Oh you, who are flung out, alike from heaven and from Hades
You murderers who've been so bitterly repaid
Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies
It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed
Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans
Though his mother has given him up for lost
Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition
Always in search of that land where life seems best
Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises
Calm and grinning, with a vanishing face
At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises
With a blue sky overhead and nothing else"
The Bewlay Brothers,The Bewlay Brothers,David Bowie,"And so the story goes, they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like the hope it was
And the goodmen tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of brawn were nicely shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss

Sighing they swirl through the streets like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our wings that bark
Flashing teeth of brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, and we were gone
Hanging out with your dwarf men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions

I was stone and he was wax
So he could scream and still relax
Unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Thru our veins and lo! It was midnight back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote cannot be found today
And it was stalking time for the moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
And the Devil may be here
But he can't sing about that
Oh, and we were gone
Real cool traders
We were so turned on
You thought we were fakers

Now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned
The factor max that proved the fact is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
And my brother lays upon the rocks
He could be dead, he could be not, he could be you
He's chameleon, comedian, Corinthian and caricature

Shooting up pie-in-the-sky
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the bad
The Bewlay Brothers
In the blessed and cold
In the crutch-hungry dark
Was where we flayed our mark
Oh, and we were gone
Kings of oblivion
We were so turned on
In the mind-warp pavilion
Lay me place and bake me pie
I'm starving for me gravy
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked
I might just slip away, hey
Just for the day, hey
Please come away, hey
Just for the day, hey
Please come away, hey"
The Bird Diverts The Wolf,The Bird Diverts The Wolf,David Bowie,"Peter said to the bird: ""Fly down and circle over the wolf's head. Only take care that he doesn't catch you.""
The bird almost touched the wolf's head with his wings while the wolf snapped angrily at him, this side and that
How that bird teased the wolf! And how the wolf wanted to catch him! But the bird was clever, and the wolf simply couldn't do anything about it"
The Dreamers,The Dreamers,David Bowie,"Black eyed ravens
They spiral down
They tilt his head back
To the flame filled sunset
Raise their guns high
As the darken falls
These are the days boys
Shallow man
Shallow man... and they
Eats in the doorway
With his head inclined
And he's always in decline
No-one heals anymore
So he shrinks as they ride
Under vermillion sky

So it goes
Just a searcher
A lonely soul
The last of the dreamers

Shallow man
Shallow man
Speaks to the shadows
Moves his trembling hands
And he's always a little late
For the dawning of the day
So it goes
Just a searcher
A lonely soul
The last of the dreamers"
The Drowned Girl,The Drowned Girl,David Bowie,"Once she had drowned and started her slow descent
Down the streams to where the great rivers broaden
Oh, the open sky shone most magnificent
As if it was acting as her body's guardian
Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight
By clasping her in their slimy grip
Through her limbs, the cold blooded fishes played
Creatures and plant life kept on, thus obstructing her last trip

And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke
And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring
But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke
To see that she got one further morning
Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair
It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from God's thoughts
First with her face, then her hands, right at the last with her hair
Leaving those corpse-choked rivers just one more corpse"
The Glass Spider,The Glass Spider,David Bowie,"Up until one century ago there lived
In the Zi Duang province of an eastern country
A glass-like spider
Having devoured its prey
It would drape the skeletons over its web
In weeks creating a macabre shrine of remains
Its web was also unique, in that it had many layers
Like floors in a building
At the top of this palace-like place
Assembled with almost apparent care
Were tiny, shining objects
Glass, beads, dewdrops
One could almost call it an altar
When the breeze blew through this construction
It produced sounds of wailing, crying
Tiny wails, tiny cries
The baby spiders would get scared
And search frantically for their mother
But the glass spider would have long gone
Having known that the babies
Would survive somehow on their own
Oh, the glass spider had blue eyes almost like a human's
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries

Don't you hear this wasted cry, life is over you
(Mommy come back because the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in Heaven, is there anyone in Hell?
Mommy come back because it's dark now
(Oh-hoho-oh)
(Oh-hoho-oh)
Take care, take care
(Mommy come back  because the water's all gone)
Somewhere she glows divine, somewhere she wakes alone
But you, you've promised in your loving eye
God it's dark now
(Mommy come back because it's dark now)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)

Gone, Gone the water's all gone
(Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
Stay low on the ground
The fire can drive you, savage and afraid
Spitting the dawn, come along before the animals awake
(Gone, gone, the water's all gone)
(Mommy come back because it's dark now)
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left
If your mama don't love ya' then the riverbed might
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
(Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
Gone gone the water's all gone
Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Gone gone the water's all gone

About the Lord above
About Satan below
About the way we love
About the rule at the top
And the people coming up
And I still don’t know
What we were looking for
But it wasn’t you
No, it wasn’t you
No, It wasn't you
It wasn’t you
No, it wasn’t you"

She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand

And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear

The Laughing Gnome,The Laughing Gnome,David Bowie,"I was walking down the high street
When I heard footsteps behind me
And there was a little old man (Hello!)
In scarlet and gray, chuckling away
Well, he trotted back to my house
And he sat beside the telly (Ahh!)
With his tiny hands on his tummy
Chuckling away, laughing all day

Well, I gave him roasted toadstools
And a glass of dandelion wine. (*burp* Pardon...)

Carried his bag, and gave him a fag
""Have you got a light, boy?""
""Here, where do you come from?""
""Gnome-man's land, heehee!""
""Oh, really?""
In the morning, when I woke up
He was sitting on the edge of my bed
With his brother, whose name was Fred
He'd brought him along to sing me a song
""Alright, let's hear it... 'ere, what's that clicking noise?""
""That's Fred, he's a metro-gnome, haha!""

You look like a rolling gnome.""
""Nah, not at the London school of Eco-gnome-ics.""

I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home

I'm gonna say goodbye he says, yeah

The gormless and the baying crowd right there
They can't get enough of that doomsday song
They can't get enough of it all
Listen

Listen to the whores he tells her
He fashions paper sculptures of them
Then drags them to the river's bank in the cart
Their soggy paper bodies wash ashore in the dark
And the priest stiff in hate now demanding fun begin
Of his women dressed as men for the pleasure of that priest

Here I am, not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me
And the next day, and the next, and another day

Ignoring the pain of their particular diseases
They chase him through the alleys chase him down the steps
They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death
And drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest
First they give you everything that you want
Then they take back everything that you have
They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees
They can work with Satan while they dress like the saints
They know God exists for the Devil told them so
They scream my name aloud down into the well below
Here I am, not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me
And the next day, and the next, and another day
Here I am, not quite dying

Never to the heavens

Brigitte Jack and Kate and Brad
From behind their tinted window stretch
Gleaming like blackened sunshine

Waiting for the first move
Satyrs and their child wives
Waiting for the last move
Soaking up our primitive world

Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever

And they know just we do
That we toss and turn at night
They're waiting to make their moves
But the stars are out tonight

Here they are upon the stairs
Sexless and unaroused
They are stars, they're dying for you
But I hope they live forever
They burn you with their radiant smiles
Trap you with their beautiful eyes
They're broke and shamed or drunk or scared
But I hope they live forever
Their jealousy's spilling down

The Width of a Circle,The Width of a Circle,David Bowie,"In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked ""Why not?"" and I replied ""I don't know""
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
Well he laughed insane and quipped Khalil Gibran
And I cried for all the others untill the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

So I said ""So long"" and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the morals of this magic spell
Negotiate my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking, my cheeks aflame
He said, you'll never go down to the Gods again
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground, a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said, do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said, do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you"
The diary of Nathan Adler or the art-ritual murder of Baby Grace Blue: A non-linear Gothic Drama Hyper-cycle,The diary of Nathan Adler or the art-ritual murder of Baby Grace Blue: A non-linear Gothic Drama Hyper-cycle,David Bowie,"It was precisely 5.47am on the morning of Friday 31 of December 1999 that a dark spirited pluralist began the dissection of 14-year-old ""Baby Grace Blue"". The arms of the victim were pin-cushioned with 16 hypodermic needles, pumping in four major preservatives, colouring agents, memory information transport fluids and some kind of green stuff. From the last and 17th, all blood and liquid was extracted. The stomach areas was carefully flapped open and the intestines removed, disentangled and re-knitted as it were, into a small net or web and hung between the pillars of the murder-location, the grand damp doorway of Oxford Town Museum of Modern Parts, New Jersey. The Limbs of Baby were then served from the torso. Each limb was implanted with a small, highly sophisticated, binary code translator which in turn was connected to small speakers attached to far ends of each limb. The self-contained mini amplifiers were then activated, amplifying the decoded memory  info-transport substances, revealing themselves as little clue haiku's, small verses detailing memories of other brutal acts, well documented by the ROMbloids. The limbs and their components were then hung upon the splayed web, slug-like prey of some unimaginable creature. The torso, by means of its bottom-most orifice, had been placed on a small support fastened to a marble base. It was shown to warring degrees of success depending upon where one stood from behind the web but in front of the Museum door itself, acting as both signifier and guardian to the act. It was definitely murder - but was it art?
All this was to be the lead-up to the most provocative event in the whole sequence of serial-events that had started around November of that same year, plunging me into the most portentous chaos-abyss that a quiet lone hacker like myself could comprehend. My name is Nathan Adler, or Detective Professor Adler in my circuit. I'm attached to the division of Art-Crime Inc., the recently instigated corporation funded by an endowment from the Arts Protectorate of London, it being felt that the investigation of art-crimes was in itself inseparable from other forms of expression and therefore worthy of support from this significant body. Nicolas Serota himself had deemed us, the small-fry of the division, worthy of an exhibit at last year's Biennale in Venice, three rooms of evidence and comparative study work which conclusively proved that the cow in Mark Tansey's ""The Innocent Bye Test"" could not differentiate between Paulus Potter's ""The Young Bull"" of 1647 (exactly 300 years before I was born, incidentally) and one of Monet's  grain stack paintings of the 1890's. The traditional art press deemed this extrapolation ""bullshit"" and removed itself to study the more formal ideas contained in Damien Hirst's ""Sheep In A Box"". Art's a farmyard. It's my job to pick thru' the manure heap looking for peppercorns.

As in any crime, my first position is to pursue the motive-gag. The recent spate, thru' '98-'99, of concept-muggings pretty much had me pulling breath for an art-murder. It was a crime whose time was now. The precedents were all there. It had probably its beginnings in the '70s with the Viennese castrationists and the blood-rituals of Nitsch. Public revulsion put the lid on that episode, but you can't keep a good down. Spurred on by Chris Burden's having himself shot by his collaborator in a gallery, tied up in a bag, thrown on a highway and then crucified upon the top of a Volkswagen, stories circulated thru' the nasty-neon of N.Y. night that a young Korean artist was the self-declared patient of wee-hours surgery in cut and run operations at not-so-secret locations in the city. If you found out about it, you could go and watch this guy having bits and pieces removed under anaesthetic. A finger-joint one night, a limb another. By the dawning of the '80s, rumour had it that he was down to a torso and one arm. He'd asked to be left in a cave in the Catskills, fed every so often by his acolytes. He didn't do much after that. I guess he read a lot. Maybe wrote a whole bunch. I suppose you can never tell what an artist will do once he's peaked. Round this same time, Bowie the singer remarked on a copula goons who frequented the Berlin bars wearing full surgery regalia; caps, aprons, rubber gloves and masks. The cutting edge. Then came Damien Hirst with the Shark-Cow-Sheep thing. No humans, palatable ritual for the world-wide public. The acceptable face of gore. Meanwhile in the US, 1994, I was in town on the night of the Athey sacrifactions.

Ron Athey,  performance artist not for the squeamish - former heroin addict-HIV positive, pushes what looks like a knitting needle repeatedly into his forehead,  a crown of blood, must hurt like hell. Stream red dribble-dribble. No screams. Face moves in pain. Carried upstage and scrubbed down in his own blood. The water. Now dresses in nice suit and tie. Now in black T-shirt and jean, carving, with a disposable scalpel, patterns, into the back of Darryl Carlton, a black man.
Bloody blotted paper towels then hung on a washing line suspended over the heads of the audience Blood-prints from life. An extremely limited edition. When it was first performed back in March. ""Four Scenes In A Harsh Life"" exploited controversy shrapnel throughout the National Endowment For the Arts. ""We have taken every precaution with our disposal systems,"" an Athey spokesperson said. ""The towels containing the blood are immediately deposited in hazardous-waste bags. Each evening, the material will be driven to a hospital for final disposal"". Athey says he is dealing with issues of self-loathing, suffering, healing and redemption.

I'm drinking up the Oxford Town, New Jersey fume. Salty and acid. Maybe I can get a handle on this thing back in Soho at the bureau. It used to be Rothko's studio, now the playground for all us Art-Crime folk, AC' or ""the daubers"" as we're dubbed. Rothko himself, in a dark-deep-drunk one night, carefully removed his clothes, folded them up neatly, placing them upon a chair, lay upon the floor in a crucified position and after several attempts, found the soft blue pump of wrists and checked out. He'd held the razor blades between wads of tissue paper so that he wouldn't cut his fingers. Deep thinker. Always was.

It's two in the morning. I can't sleep for the screaming of some poor ostracized Turkish immigrant screaming his guts out from over the street. His hawking shriek sounds semi-stifled like he's got a pillow over his mouth. But the desperation comes through the spongy rubber like a knife. It cuts the breeze and bangs my eardrums. I take a walk past the fabric machine, turn left onto a street with no name, The caucasian suicide centre, naked and grimy, silhouetted by fungus yellow street lamps female slashing way-out saints for a dollar a time thrown downstairs if you can't take any more. Pure joy of retreat into death, led by the shepherdess. Anti mixed-race posters pasted upon their alter of pop-death icons party people. A zero with no name looks dull-eyed to Ms. Stone, the drone that says ""in the future, everything was up to itself"". Yes. I remember Ramona. She set herself up as the no-future priestess of the Caucasian Suicide Temple, vomiting out her doctrine of death-as-eternal- party into the empty vessels of Berlin youth. The top floor rooms were the gateways to giving up to the holy ghost. She must have overseen more than 30 or 40 check-outs before the local squad twigged what was going down.

New Yorker Magazine, advanced copy, celebrating fashion. It's a first of its kind since Tina Brown took over as editor. One look is all it took. It took the look and wrote a new book on what sophistaplites would take and bake. Guy Bourdin featured heavily in this new eDISHion. Since the advent of AIDS and the new morality, and, of course, his death, his dark sexy fatal style had fallen out of Vogue. An uncompromising photographer, he had found a twisty avenue through desire and death. A white female leg sticking gloomily out of a bath of black liquid enamel. Two glued up babes covered in tiny pearls. The glue prevented their skins from breathing and they pass out. ""Oh it would be beautiful."" he is to have said. ""to photograph them dead in bed."" He was a French Guy. Ha had known Man Ray. Loved Lewis Carroll.
His first gig was doing hats for Vogue. He'd place dead flies or bees on the faces of the models, or, female head wears hat crushed between three skinned calves heads, tongues lolling. Well, it was the '50s, that was it was. The tight-collor '50s seen through unspeakable hostility. He wanted but he couldn't paint. So he threw globs of revengeful hatred at his mobile subjects. He would systematically pull the phone cord out of the wall. He was never to be disturbed. Disturbed. Never. Everything and everyone died around him. One shoot focusing upon a women lying in bed was said to be a reconstruction of his estranged wife's death. Another picture has a women in a phone booth making some frantic call. Her hand is pressed whitely against the glass. Behind her and outside are two female bodies partially covered by the autumn leaves. His dream, so he told his friends, was to do shoots in the morgue, with the stiffs as mannequins, I don't know. I just read this stuff. Now his spirit was being resurrected. We're mystified by blood. It's our enemy now. We don't understand it.
Can't live with it. Can't , well... y'know?
friday, december 31, 1999, 11.30 am
After Surgery and investment in a bullet-proof mask, Ramona turned up in London, Canada as owner of a string of body-parts jewellery stores. Lamb penis necklaces, goat-scrotum purses, nipple earrings, that sort of thing. The word on the street, however, suggested that it was not in the best of interests to become one of her clients as occasionally, a customer would step into her shop and not come out again. The whistle blew after a much-loved and highly respected celebrity, known for being known, failed to show for a gallery-hanging of her mirrors. Other celebrities, equally known for being known, some only to each other, thought it was the most profound exhibit in years and couldn't take their eyes off the works. All the pieces sold within an hour, many for record prices. When the critic for Date magazine asked for an interview with the celebrity-artist, the gallery owner recalled that he hadn't seen her since earlier that day. She'd mentioned that she would be going shopping for a diamond-encrusted umbilical cord as a celebratory thing to announce her pregnancy. She would be back in an hour. Just a quick stop at the ""Gallstone"". 1986. That pregnancy would have produced a being that would be around 14 years of age.
If it was still alive.

There Is a Happy Land,There Is a Happy Land,David Bowie,"There is a happy land where only children live
They don't have the time to learn the ways Of you sir, Mr. Grownup
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there Mr. Grownup
Go away sir
Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's going to buy a kite
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us
Mother calls, but we don't hear
There's lots more things to do
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet
But we will be, very shortly
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray
There is a happy land where only children live
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup
Go away sir
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup"
This Is Not America,This Is Not America (Ft. Pat Metheny Group),David Bowie,"This is not America (Sha la la la la)

Little piece of you
The little peace in me
Will die (This is not a miracle)
For this is not America

Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare
Too long (This is not America)
For this is not the miracle

There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

For this is not America
(Sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la)
This is not America, no
This is not (Sha la la la la)
Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals to the ground

So bloody red, tomorrow's clouds

For this could be the biggest sky

Threepenny Pierrot,Threepenny Pierrot,David Bowie,"Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot
Happy little feet that dance all day
Lonely little heart with lots to say
Stepping footprints on your mind
Offering thoughts of Columbine
Bang the drum and blow the bugle call
Pierrot takes the stage to play for all
For here's a life his fortune rules
Forsaken by his Columbine
Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot
To tap his feet to greet dear Harlequin
The hearts of folks so keenly hard to win
A patchwork frame of tears and wine
The nectar for cruel Columbine
The part of three and leaves the stage forlorn
Puppets cold, their faces sad and drawn
Relive each trial of rise and fall
The love which lacks between us all
Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot
Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too

Stomping along
On this big Philip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
Looking across at Richard Rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
To leave a job
When you know
You know the money's from day to day

All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams
In my mind's eye
All the joy I see
Thru these architect's eyes
(We're living in the golden, in the golden age)
(We're living in the golden age, the golden age)
Cold winter bleeds
On the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and the rocks and the sand
Stomping along on this big Philip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
These summer scumholes
This goddamned starving life

All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams

Thursday’s Child,Thursday's Child,David Bowie,"All of my life I've tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same
Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
Breaking my life in two

Throw me tomorrow
Now that I've really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow
Everything's falling into place
Throw me tomorrow
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's child

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was

Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet
Lucky old sun is in my sky
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
Innocence in your arms

Throw me tomorrow
Now that I've really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow
Everything's falling into place
Throw me tomorrow
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's child

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was

Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, Boy
Time - In Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain
Regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain
And many other last names

'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard
But keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams
I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind
But love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed
Your park was real and dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now
Smiling through this darkness

Is guilt for dreaming

Pain is over me, overloading
I don't know why but you're trying to be kind
Take off your silver smile, throw your head back
And cry
I don't believe but I'm trying to decide
Which game is best for me, which can I bare
You don't perseve so I'm leading you away
Home were you've never been, non-returning
So cry
Throw a rock upon the road and it breaks into pieces
Shake brach upon the snow and the sun is defeated
Pull the curtains on yesterday and it seems so much later
Put a bullet in my brain and I'll make all the papers
I don't know why but I'm tired of my life
The clouds are in my eyes, overtaking"
Tonight,Tonight (Ft. Tina Turner),David Bowie,"I saw my baby
She was turning blue
I knew that soon
Her young life was through
And so I got down on my knees
Down by her bed
And these are the words
To her I said

Everything will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight

I will love you until I die
I will see you in the sky

You look trapped, turn the radio on
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone

But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking, looking, looking for a break

Is it love or is it what
Who's this guy I'm going to blow away (ay)
What kind of love is he giving you
I'mma dizzy's
What I'm trying to say

I'm a bad loser
I'm shaking in anger
I'mma too dizzy
You can't have no lover
Don't come any harder
Don't come any closer
You can go on dreaming every night
But I'm not letting you out of my sight
I'm ten times the man than any guy around
But you're just itching, twitching, itching for a break
There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes

But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking, looking, looking for a break

Is it love or is it what

"Try Some, Buy Some","Try Some, Buy Some",David Bowie,"Way back in time
Someone said try some
I tried some
Now buy some, I bought some
Oh oh oh
After a while
When I had tried them, denied them
I opened my eyes and I saw you

Not a thing did I have
Not a thing did I see
Untill I called on your love
And your love came to me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh

Through my life
I've seen grey sky, met big fry
Seen them die to get high
Ohhh
And when it seemed that I would only be lonely
I opened my eyes and I saw you
Not a thing did I feel
Not a thing did I know
Untill I called on your love
And your love sure did grow
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh

Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some

Tryin’ To Get To Heaven,Tryin' To Get To Heaven,David Bowie,"The air is getting hotter
There's a rumbling in the sky
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With heat rising through my eyes
Every day, your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't hurt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Tryin' to get to Heaven before they close the door
Oh, hey, yeah

Oh, when I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see
They broke the heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I've been walking that lonesome valley
Tryin' to get to Heaven before they close the door
Oh, oh, yeah

Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Oh, people on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts are beatin'
Like pendulums swingin' on a chain
When you think you lost everything
You find out you can lose a little more
I, I'm just going down the, that road feeling bad
Tryin' hard to get to Heaven before they close the door

Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door

Ooh
Oh-oh-oh

Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
I'm going down the river
Going down to New Orleans
They tell me everything's gonna be alright
But I don't know what alright even means
I close my eyes and I wonder, boys
If everything is as hollow as it seems
I've been to Sugar Town, oh, shook the sugar down
Tryin' to get to Heaven before they close the door, hey

Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven (Tryin' to get there)
Before they close the door (Woo, door)
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven (Tryin' to get to Heaven)
Before they close the door (And relive my dreams there)
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door (I've been all around the world, boys)

I like the tee shirts
In Borneo
Some wear Bob Marley
Others in Playboy
Or Duvalier
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
With a book on Borneo

Strangers come and go
It's such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day
But even in springtime
It's a rich slice of life
So send me a letter

Watches from the tree tops
In Borneo

When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
That's the way it goes
Way down yonder in Borneo

Far beneath his mansion
There's an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the general shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle

(We'll meet in borneo)
They laugh and they mumble
(We are *unclear*)
Enjoying the show
(We'll meet in borneo)
And that dusky mulatto
(I like the free world)
Hot juice in coke bottles
(We'll meet in borneo)
In blue jeans and tattoos

Well, they twirl and they tumble

Yes, they twirl and they tumble

Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble

Uncle Arthur,Uncle Arthur,David Bowie,"Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up
Climbs across his bike and he's away
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street
Back to mother, it's another empty day

Uncle Arthur likes his mommy
Uncle Arthur still reads comics
Uncle Arthur follows Batman

Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion
Sally was the real thing, not just lust

Uncle Arthur vanished quickly
Uncle Arthur and his new bride
Uncle Arthur follows Sally

Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks
Uncle Arthur past the river
Uncle Arthur down the high street
Uncle Arthur follows mother"
Under Pressure,Under Pressure (Ft. Queen),David Bowie,"Mmm num ba de

Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher

Watching some good friends screaming
'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why - why - why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?
Because love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (people on streets) edge of the night
And love (people on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure

Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed,Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed,David Bowie,"Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to
You won't be the first or last

It must strain you to look down
So far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me
In his house could do for you

I'm the cream
Of the great Utopia dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen

I'm a Phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye socket's empty
See nothing but pain
I keep havin' this brainstorm
About twelve times a day
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me
Quite amazed
As I am unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed

I've got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a Queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream

So now you could spend your morning talking with me
Quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed

Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching
So now, you should spend the morning, lying to your father
Quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazed
I'm not following

Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah
Don't sit down
Don't sit down
Don't sit down"

And the possibilities it seems to offer

It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

A series of shocks - sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling, witnesses falling

It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

Yeah, yeah, yeah, up the hill backwards
It'll be alright, ooh-ooh

While we sleep, they go to work
We're legally crippled, it's the death of love

It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

You got rings on your fingers and your hair's hot red
You got the width of my tongue, name on the sun
I clutch you close to my breast 'cause you're the only one
Who uses school to pleasure

You make me act real gone, you make me troll along
I had to ravish your capsule, suck you dry
Feel the teeth in your bones, heal ya head with my own
Why if I don't have you whole, is that your final love?
Here all together

Velvet goldmine, you stroke me like the rain
Snake it, take it, panther princess you must stay
Velvet goldmine, naked on your chain
I'll be your king volcano, right for you again and again
My velvet goldmine

You're my taste, my trip, I'll be your master zip
I'll chop your hair off for kicks, you'll make me jump to my feet
So you'll give me your hand, give me your sound
Let me sea wash your face, I'm falling, I can't stand
Ooh, clutch your makeup
Velvet goldmine, you stroke me like the rain
Snake it, take it, panther princess you must stay

Volare (Nel blu dipinto di blu),Volare (Nel blu dipinto di blu),David Bowie,"Nel blu dipinto di blu, felice di stare lassù
Nel blu dipinto di blu, felice di stare lassù
Penso che un sogno così non ritorni mai più
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito
Volare, oh oh
Cantare, oh oh oh
Nel blu dipinto di blu, felice di stare lassù
E volavo, volavo felice, più in alto del sole ed ancora più su
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggiù
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me
Volare, oh oh
Cantare, oh oh oh
Nel blu dipinto di blu, felice di stare lassù
Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu, felice di stare quaggiù
E continuo a volare felice, più in alto del sole ed ancora più su
Mentre il mondo pian piano scompare negli occhi tuoi blu
La tua voce e' una musica dolce che suona per me
Volare, oh oh
Cantare, oh oh oh
Nel blu dipinto di blu, felice di stare lassù

Watch That Man,Watch That Man,David Bowie,"Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmied and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so
Yea! it was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! so it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame

Watch that man!
Oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man!
Oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were joking, the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played the Tiger Rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! I ran to the street
Looking for information
Watch that man!
Oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man!
Oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

Watch that man

Waterloo Sunset,Waterloo Sunset,David Bowie,"Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy, makes me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright
But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

Every day I look at the world from my window
Chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

Terry meets Julie at Waterloo Station
Every Friday night
But I am so lazy, don't want to wander
I stay at home at night
But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

Every day I look at the world from my window
Chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine
Millions of people swarming like flies 'round Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound
And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise

Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine

We Are Hungry Men,We Are Hungry Men,David Bowie,"Here is the news
According the latest world population survey
The figures have reached danger point, my god
London 15 million 75 thousand
New York 80 million
Paris 15 million and 30
China 1000 million
Billington-Spa: lots

My studies include exophagy
I formed my own society
To crush the power of fecundity
The world will overpopulate
Unless you claim infertility
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel
That they are not infertible
The crops are few, the cattle gone
There's only one way to linger on
So who will buy a drink for me, your
Messiah
Achtung, achtung, these are your orders
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their
Allotted amount of air
Will be slaughtered and cremated
One only cubic foot of air is
I have prepared a document, legalising mass abortion
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

You don't seem to hear me clear
Do I talk about your sphere?
Let me explain my project dear
Show you how I'll save the world
Or let it die within the year
Why do you look that way at me, your messiah

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives
We are hungry men
We don't give a damn for what you're saying

We Are the Dead,We Are the Dead,David Bowie,"Something kind of hit me today
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way
People will hold us to blame
It hit me today, it hit me today
We're taking it hard all the time
Why don't we pass it by?
Just reply, you've changed your mind
We're fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard, taking it hard
Yet now
We feel that we are paper, choking on you nightly
They tell me: son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far
For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin
For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
You're just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead
One thing kind of touched me today
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night
Knowing it's right, knowing it's right
Now I'm hoping some one will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared
Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care, someone will care
But now
We're today's scrambled creatures
Locked in tomorrow's double feature
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell
It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell
And the streets are full of pressmen
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while you're sleeping
It's the theatre of financiers
Count them, fifteen 'round a table
White and dressed to kill
Oh, caress yourself, my juicy
For my hands have all but withered
Oh, dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead
We are the dead
We are the dead"

When I’m Five,When I'm Five,David Bowie,"When I'm five
I will wash my face and hands all by myself
When I'm five
I will chew and spit tobacco like my grandfather Jones
'Cause I'm only four and five is far away
When I'm five
I will read the magazines in mummy's drawer
When I'm five
I will walk behind the soldiers in the May Day parade
'Cause I'm only four and grown-ups walk too fast
Yesterday was horrid day, 'cause Raymond kicked my shin
And mummy says if I am good, she'll let me go to school in August
Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast
And I laughed when Bonzo licked my face, because it tickled
I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five
When I'm five
I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I won't be sick
When I'm five
I will jump in puddles, laugh in church and marry my mum
And I'll let my daddy do the washing-up
If I close one eye, the people on that side can't see me
I get headaches in the morning and I rode on Freddie's tri-cy-cle
And everywhere was funny, when I ran down to the sweetshop
Then I fell and bleeded-up my knee and everybody soppied me
I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five

When the Boys Come Marching Home,When the Boys Come Marching Home,David Bowie,"How to make amends for the things they say
The girls avoid the stormy sky
But I and my cloudy face
Will be gone, high-tailing out of here
Is the lights a-blazing in their lonely town?
I love the little cars at dawn
But I and my heathen heart
Will be lain upon some foreign shore
Here's the saddest Joe on the corner of the town
""Listen to the words!"" he cries
I love him in his craziness, his tatters and his courage
He'll thumb his nose at the straight and true
When the boys come marching home
They'll fly his rags from the highest tree
When the boys come marching home
(when the boys come marching home)
(home, marching home)
Aching for some innocence and peace of mind
While the moon pulls up its net of souls
The sun presses down on my brave new world
But, in truth, i don't feel brave at all
Leave it all behind me to the townies and the wags
The kids who never learned to smile
While I and the cobbled nag I ride
Stumble down another weary mile
Here's to those who cluster
Walking through the wars
The girls who never close 'til dawn
They rag upon the feeble
And they swan around the stronger
But their eyes are fixed on the edge of town
When the boys come marching home
They'll slide from view - tiny, two by two
When the boys come marching home
(home, marching home)
(home, marching home)
When the boys come marching home
(when the boys come marching home)
Boys come marching home

And I've never felt the sun
I dread to think of when
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows

Life burns a savage wound, angry and wrong
Trusting a twisted word, you'll run, run away
You'll take him home
You'll spit and taunt him
But they won't believe you
No matter what you'll say

So long child, it's awful dark

Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And Mummy didn't need no boys

Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone

Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
Get your feet back on the ground

Who Can I Be Now?,Who Can I Be Now?,David Bowie,"Everybody’s raised in blindness

Everybody feels that everything is real

Nobody can break their bondage
Everyone can feel their chains
But even in my life I knew you found your sight
And nothing would be quite the same
Please help me
Who can I be now?
You found me, Oooo
Can I be held apart?
You found me, now can I be?
Now you found me, Now can I be real?
Can I be real?

If it’s all a vast creation
Putting on a face that’s new
Someone has to see
A role for him and me
Someone might as well be you
Up in heaven, any angel
Writes a special game to play
Oh, could we, could we make a start
To snatch their Angels part?
A major role for everyday
Please help me

Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind

I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me

Breathing in only doubt

I'm sorry little girl

The pain must feel like snow

We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down

Heaven knows he's for it
Sha-a-a-me!
Hey hey
He was never quite unsure but really sane
Wants to play
Jackson stole twenty souls in a day
To take away
A take away
He takes away
And no complaints
Heart's upon his sleeve and his blade
Wood Jackson took the beating every day, given out, passed away, another way
Hey hey
Just wants to play
And how he played
The mob they bleed and tremble when they're running after life
Heaven knows he's really torn it now
The words that killed Wood Jackson's friends were written on the wall
Heaven knows he's for it
Shame!

It's a shame

It's a shame
Wants to play

You Feel So Lonely You Could Die,You Feel So Lonely You Could Die,David Bowie,"No one ever saw you moving through the dark
Leaving slips of paper somewhere in the park
Hidden from your friends, stealing all they knew
Love is thrown in airless rooms, then vile rewards for you

And I'm gonna tell, yes, I've gotta tell
Gotta tell the things you said
When you're talking in the dark
And I'm gonna tell the things you've done
When you're walking through the park

Some night on the thriller’s street
Will come the silent gun
You've got a dangerous heart
You stole their trust, their moon, their sun
They'll come such assassin's needle on a crowded train
I bet you feel so lonely you could die

Buildings crammed with people, landscapes filled with wrath
Gray concrete city, rain has wet the street
I want to see you clearly before you close the door
A room of bloody history, you made sure of that
I can see you as a corpse hanging from a beam
I could read you like a book
I can feel you falling
I hear you moaning in your room
Oh, see if I care
Oh, please, please make it soon

Walls have got you cornered
You've got the blues, my friend
And people don't like you
But you will leave without a sound, without an end
Oblivion shall own you
Death alone shall love you
I hope you feel so lonely you could die
Feel so lonely you could die
You feel so lonely you could die"

Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries ""Where have all Papa's heroes gone?""

Do you remember, the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?

Just you and your idol sing falsetto
'bout Leather, leather everywhere
And not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and

Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache

I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?

But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's Band

Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man,
Well hung, snow white tan

So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass
He was the naz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar

Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed a man
I had to break up the band

Oh yeah
Ooh

Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
‘Tis my curse, I suppose
That was patrol

This is the war

Black struck the kiss, she kept my cock
Smote the mistress, drifting on
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
She stole my purse, with rattling speed
That was patrol
This is the war

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time

Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day

Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

Though nothing, nothing will keep us together

Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes

We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day

Sets sail

And all you got is grieving
And all you know is needing

Are you tough enough to be kind?
Do you know your heart has its own mind?
Darkness gathers around the light
Hold on
Hold on

Take the heat from the sun

I know that everything is not ok

True love never can be rent
But only true love can keep beauty innocent

I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman
No I could never take a chance
'Cause I could never understand
The mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

You can run from love
And if it's really love it will find you
Catch you by the heel
But you can't be numb for love
The only pain is to feel nothing at all
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?
I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman
And you're the one, there's no-one else
It makes me want to lose myself
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

Brown eyed girl across the street
On rue Saint Divine
I thought this is the one for me
But she was already mine
You were already mine

Little sister
I've been sleeping in the street again
Like a stray dog
Little sister
I've been trying to feel complete again
But you're gone and so is God
The soul needs beauty for a soul mate
When the soul wants, the soul waits

I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman
For love and faith and sex and fear
And all the things that keep us here
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

How can I hurt when I'm holding you?"

Time to heal, desire time
And your earth moves beneath
Your own dream landscape

Oh, oh, oh
On borderland we run
I'll be there
I'll be there
Tonight, a high road
A high road out from here

The city walls are all gone down
The dust, a smokescreen all around
See faces ploughed like fields that once
Gave no resistance
And we live by the side of the road
On the side of a hill as the valley explode
Dislocated, suffocated
The land grows weary of its own

Oh come away, say I

This bomb-blast lightning waltz
No spoken words
Just a scream, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Tonight we'll build a bridge
Across the sea and land
See the sky, the burning rain
She will die and live again
Tonight

You can throw it up, or choke on it
And you can dream, so dream out loud
You know that your time is coming round
So don't let the bastards grind you down
No, nothing makes sense, nothing seems to fit
I know you'd hit out if you only knew who to hit
And I'd join the movement
If there was one I could believe in
Yeah, I'd break bread and wine
If there was a church I could receive in
Cause I need it now
To take the cup
To fill it up, to drink it slow
I can't let you go

To talk like this and act like that
And you can dream, so dream out loud
And don't let the bastards grind you down

No new ideas in the house, and every book's been read

And you can build, and I can will

The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures
Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace
When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun

When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks?

Your machinery is too much for me
You made me want to be a saint

Too many mothers weepin'
Dream on Brother John
But in your dreams you can't be sleepin'

You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul
American
American

Put your hands in the air
Hold up the sky
Could be too late, but we still gotta try
There's a moment in our life where a soul can die
And the person in a country when you believe the lie
The lie (the lie, the lie)
There's a promise in the heart of every good dream
It's a call to action, not to fantasy
The end of a dream, the start of what's real
Let it be unity
Let it be community
For refugees like you and me
A country to receive us
Will you be our sanctuary
Refu-Jesus
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul

You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul

In the side streets and the alleyways

See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

It's a beautiful day

Man at the door says if I want to stay alive a bit longer
There's three things I need you to know — three!
Coming from a long line of travelling sales people on my mother's side
I wasn't gonna buy just anyone's cockatoo
So why would I invite a complete stranger into my home?
Would you?

These days are better than that
These days are better than that

Every day I die again, and again I'm reborn
Every day I have to find the courage

To walk out into the street
With arms out
Got a love you can't defeat
Neither down or out
There's nothing you have that I need
I can breathe

And I'm coming down with some new Asian virus
Ju Ju man, Ju Ju man
Doc says you're fine, or dying
Please
Nine 0 nine, St John Divine, on the line, my pulse is fine
But I'm running down the road like loose electricity
While the band in my head plays a striptease

The roar that lies on the other side of silence
The forest fire that is fear, so deny it

Walk out into the street
Sing your heart out
The people we meet
Will not be drowned out (hey)
There's nothing you have that I need
I can breathe
Breathe now


We are people born of sound
The songs are in our eyes
Gonna wear them like a crown

Through the alleys of a quiet city street
And take the staircase to the first floor

As a man breathes into his saxophone
And through the walls you hear the city groan

Cedars Of Lebanon,Cedars Of Lebanon (Ft. Harold Budd),U2,"Yesterday I spent asleep
Woke up in my clothes in a dirty heap
Spent the night trying to make a deadline
Squeezing complicated lives into a simple headline
I have your face in an old Polaroid
Tidying the children's clothes and toys
You're smiling back at me, I took the photo from the fridge
Can't remember what then we did
I haven't been with a woman, it feels like for years
Thought of you the whole time, your salty tears
This shitty world sometimes produces a rose
The scent of it lingers, and then it just goes
Return the call to home
The worst of us are a long drawn-out confession
The best of us are geniuses of compression
You say you're not going to leave the truth alone
I'm here 'cause I don't want to go home
Child drinking dirty water from the river bank
Soldier brings oranges he got out from a tank
I'm waiting on the waiter, he's taking a while to come
Watching the sun go down on Lebanon
Return the call to home
Now I've got a head like a lit cigarette
Unholy clouds reflect in a minaret
You're so high above me, higher than everyone
Where are you in the cedars of Lebanon?
Choose your enemies carefully, 'cause they will define you
Make them interesting, 'cause in some ways they will mind you
They're not there in the beginning, but when your story ends
Gonna last with you longer than your friends"
Cedarwood Road,Cedarwood Road,U2,"I was running down the road
The fear was all I knew
I was looking for a soul that’s real
Then I ran into you
And that cherry blossom tree
Was a gateway to the sun
And friendship, once it’s won
It’s won... it’s won

Northside just across the river to the Southside
That’s a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide, the joy you hold
The foolish pride that gets you out the door
Up on Cedarwood, Cedarwood Road

Sleepwalking down the road
Not waking from these dreams
‘Cause it’s never dead, it’s still my head
It was a warzone in my teens
I’m still standing on that street
Still need an enemy
The worst ones I can’t see
You can... you can
Northside just across the river from the Southside
That’s a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide and the joy you hold
The foolish pride that sends you back for more
Up on Cedarwood, Cedarwood Road

If the door is open it isn’t theft
You can’t return to where you’ve never left
Blossoms falling from a tree, they cover you and cover me
Symbols clashing, Bibles smashing
Paint the world you need to see
Sometimes fear is the only place that we can call our home
Cedarwood Road

And a heart that is broken
Is a heart that is open, open, open"

Crumbs From Your Table,Crumbs From Your Table,U2,"From the brightest star
Comes the blackest hole
You had so much to offer
Why did you offer your soul?
I was there for you baby
When you needed my help
Would you deny for others
What you demand for yourself?

Cool down mama, cool off
Cool down mama, cool off

You speak of signs and wonders
But I need something other
I would believe if I was able
But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table

You were pretty as a picture
It was all there to see
Then your face caught up with your psychology
With a mouth full of teeth
You ate all your friends
And you broke every heart thinking every heart mends
You speak of signs and wonders
But I need something other
I would believe if I was able
But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table

Where you live should not decide
Whether you live or whether you die

She is connecting with me
Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me
I'm dancing barefoot
Headed for a spin
Some strange music drags me in
It makes me come up like some heroine
She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on
He who is chosen by she
Here I go when I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me
I'm dancing barefoot
Headed for a spin
Some strange strange music drags me in
It makes me come up like some heroine
She is recreation She intoxicated by thee
She has the slow sensation that
He is levitating with she
Here I go when I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly 'Til I lose my sense of gravity
I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music drives me on
Makes me come up like some heroine

Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come in to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen

You're out in the hall
Waltzing the blues
Now you hurt somewhere
They won't find a bruise
You've been learning to walk
In those dancin' shoes
I had a mama, she told me 'bout you
She said true love don't lie
You touch that woman
And the smoke won't leave your eyes

Dragging me down
That's not the way it used to be

What I'm trying to forget

It was a dirty day
Dirty day

Looking for explanations
I don't even understand
If you need someone to blame
Throw a rock in the air, you'll hit someone guilty

Hear what I say
Nothing's as simple as you think
Wake up
Some things you can't get around
I'm in you
More so when they put me in the ground

Alone, like the painter's dog without a bone
When there's only one thing you need to own
And that is hunger, hunger itself
I know you're (missing)
Your (missing) is ripped and it is torn to shreds
From all the lovers taken to your beds
They're empty now
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love someone in to love
You do your disappearing act
You do your disappearing act
Jealousy, it's not what it's cracked up to be
Envy, gets you where you need to be
Alone, rather the river than your stepping stones
Leave the graveyard before you turn to bones
I'm tragic, you're comedy
Oh, baby doll, the dogs are barking, they need to be fed
All the lepers you let in your head - is it empty now?
Cause you think that can love
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love someone into love

Take the colours of my imagination
Take the scent hanging in the air
Take this tangle of a conversation
Turn it into your own prayer
With my fingers as you want them
With my nails under your hide
With my teeth at your back
And my tongue to tell you the sweetest lies

Stick together man and a woman
Stick together

Restless on the farm
A boy filled with wanderlust
Who never really meant no harm
He'll change his clothes and shine his boots
And he combed his dark hair down
But his mama cried as he walked away

He laughed and kissed his mom and said
""Your Billy Joe is the man
I can shoot as quick, I can shoot as straight

But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down""

Leave your guns at home

To calm his shaking hands
And he tried, he tried to tell himself
At last, he had become a man

Began to laugh him down

I can't stand my own mind
America, when will we end the human war
Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb
I don't feel good, don't bother me
I won't write my poem till I'm in my right mind
America, when will you be angelic
When will you take off your clothes
When will you look at yourself through the grave
When will you be worthy of your million Trotskyites
America, why are your libraries full of tears
America, when will you send your eggs to India
I'm sick of your insane demands
When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks
America, after all, it is you and I who are perfect, not the next world
Your machinery is too much for me
You made me want to be a saint
There must be some other way to settle this argument
Burroughs is in Tangiers
I don't think he'll come back, it's sinister
Are you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke
I'm trying to come to the point
I refuse to give up my obsession

Eclipse, you elevate my soul

I've got no self-control
Been living like a mole
Now going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation

A star, lit up like a cigar
Strung out like a guitar
Maybe you could educate my mind
Explain all these controls
I can't sing but I've got soul
The goal is elevation

I've lost all self-control
Been living like a mole
Now going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation
Love, lift me out of these blues
Won't you tell me something true
I believe in you

A mole, digging in a hole
Digging up my soul
Going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation

Burning rubber, burning chrome
Bay of Cadiz and ferry home
Atlantic sea cut glass
African sun at last
Oooooh, ooooh, ohhhhhh, ooooohhh

Like memories
A speeding head, a speeding heart
I'm being born, a bleeding start
The engines roar, blood curling wail
Head first then foot
Then heart sets sail"

And I'm falling over
There's a fire in me
When I call out
You built a fire, fire
I'm going home

Flower Child,Flower Child,U2,"On the fifth day of May she was breaking away
When the moon came and sat on your shoulder
She was still young, not yet highly strung
As you need to be when you get older
George was a street when you first faced the feat
You put money on the color of the sky
Well the color of her voice left you there no choice
But to drink the Liffey dry
The seeds that you sow
You wanna watch them growing
Wild, you grow wild
You grow wild in my heart
Wild, you grow wild
You grow wild in my heart
Here comes Holy Joe now how would he know
How laughter can make a man cruel
It's fire on fire and lovers conspire
To either a duet or duel
When it's fire on fire the flames just get higher
The harder you work to put them out
Well you know that you're similar sugar and weedkiller
Both heading north facing south
The seeds that you sow
You wanna watch them growing
Wild, you grow wild
You grow wild in my heart
Wild, you grow wild
You grow wild in my heart
Wild
What's on your breath is the fear of death
That makes such a man promiscuous
Your mouth was dry like when you were about to lie
And her lips are so luscious
You've seen it before, you hurled at her door
Like a dog when she needed a man
Now she aches and she breaks and she takes
On the weight of your world because she almost can
The seeds that you sow
Well you wanna watch them growing
The wind, where will it blow, my flower child
Growing wild, you grow wild
You grow wild in my heart
Wild, you grow wild
You grow wild in my heart
Wild
The sky was still grey up on Appian Way
As the yellow hats dug up the road
Didn't hear what you said as the lights turned red
On a love that should have stayed gold
Wild, you grow wild
You grow wild in my heart
Wild, you grow wild
You grow wild in my heart
Wild, you grow wild
You grow wild in my heart
Wild, you grow wild
You grow wild in my heart"

Get out of your own way, hey, hey

Love hurts
Now you're the girl who's left with no words
Your heart's a balloon, but then it bursts
It doesn't take a cannon, just a pin
Your skin's not covering
And resistance
Love has got to fight for its existence
The enemy has armies of assistance
The amorous, the glamorous, the kiss
A fist, listen to this, oh

Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I

I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight
Fight back
Don't take it lyin' down, you got to bite back
The face of liberty's starting to crack
She had a plan up until she got a smack in the mouth
And it all went south
Like freedom
The slaves are lookin' for someone to lead them
The master's lookin' for someone to need him
The promised land is there for those who need it most
And Lincoln's ghost said...

Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I

I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight

Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

Blessed are the arrogant
For there is the kingdom of their own company
Blessed are the superstars
For the magnificence in their light
We understand better our own insignificance
Blessed are the filthy rich
For you can only truly own what you give away

God Part II,God Part II,U2,"Don't believe the devil
I don't believe his book
But the truth is not the same
Without the lies he made up

Success is to give
Don't believe in riches
But you should see where I live
I, I believe in love

Don't believe in forced entry
Don't believe in rape

Wild thoughts escape

Skid row or the gangs

If I don't get him first
Don't believe that Rock 'n' Roll
Can really change the world
As it spins in revolution
Yeah, it spirals and turns
I, I believe in love

Don't believe in the sixties
The golden age of pop
You glorify the past
When the future dries up
Heard a singer on the radio
Late last night
Says he's gonna kick the darkness
Till it bleeds daylight

I'm spinnin' on a wheel
It always stops beside a name
A presence I can feel
I believe in love

Gone,Gone,U2,"You get to feel so guilty
Got so much for so little
Then you find that feeling just won't go away

Till there's nothing left for you anyway

Goodbye, you can keep this suit of lights
I'll be up with the sun
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down

You wanted to get somewhere so badly
You had to lose yourself along the way
You changed your name
Well that's okay, it's necessary
And what you leave behind you don't miss anyway

Goodbye, you can keep this suit of lights
I'll be up with the sun
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
'Cause I'm already gone
Felt that way all along
Closer to you every day
I didn't want it that much anyway

You're taking steps that make you feel dizzy
Then you learn to like the way it feels
You hurt yourself, you hurt your lover
Then you discover
What you thought was freedom is just greed

Goodbye, and it's an emotional
Goodnight, I'll be up with the sun
Are you still holding on?
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down"
Grace,Grace,U2,"Grace, she takes the blame
She covers the shame
Removes the stain
It could be her name
Grace, it's the name for a girl
It's also a thought that changed the world
And when she walks on the street
You can hear the strings
Grace finds goodness in everything
Grace, she's got the walk
Not on a ramp or on chalk
She's got the time to talk
She travels outside of karma
She travels outside of karma
When she goes to work
You can hear her strings
Grace finds beauty in everything
Grace, she carries a world on her hips
No champagne flute for her lips
No twirls or skips between her fingertips
She carries a pearl in perfect condition
What once was hurt
What once was friction
What left a mark
No longer stings
Because Grace makes beauty
Out of ugly things
Grace finds beauty
In everything
Grace finds goodness
In everything"
Hallelujah,Hallelujah,U2,"I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music do you
It goes like this, the fourth the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing, Hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You say I took the name in vain
Though I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter what you heard
The holy or the broken, Hallelujah
Hallelujah...
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well, maybe there's a God above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's no complaint you hear tonight
It's not some pilgrim who's seen the light
It's a cold and broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah"

I Believe In Father Christmas,I Believe In Father Christmas,U2,"They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
But instead it just kept on raining
A veil of tears for the virgin birth
I remember one Christmas morning
A winters light and a distant choir
And the peal of a bell and that Christmas Tree smell
And eyes full of tinsel and fire
They sold me a dream of Christmas
They sold me a Silent Night
And they told me a fairy story
'Till I believed in the Israelite
And I believed in Father Christmas
And I looked to the sky with excited eyes
'Till I woke with a yawn in the first light of dawn
And I saw him and through his disguise
I wish you a hopeful Christmas
I wish you a brave New Year
All anguish pain and sadness
Leave your heart and let your road be clear
They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
Hallelujah Noel be it Heaven or Hell
The Christmas we get we deserve"

You wrote the letter, said you were gonna
Get there someday
Gonna walk in the sun
And the wind and the rain
Never look back again
Now you fall down
You're falling down

You fall down
You're falling down
You fall down

Julie say something, Julie say you're sorry
You're gonna get better, you better not
Leave me here anyway
I want to get up, when you wake up
But when I get up
I fall down
I'm falling down
I fall down
I broke myself
I fall, I fall down
I'm falling down
I fall down
When you fall
I fall with you
And when you're falling down
Is when I hit the ground
I fall with you
I fall down"

Gonna make it up, as I go along
Gonna make it up, babe, as I go along
Gonna make you a ribbon and tie it to song
Gonna make it up, baby, as I go along
'Cause I love you, and our love is true
Gonna make it up missus in my heat
Gonna take the song back off of my feet
Gonna make it up babe when I'm asleep
And a soul laid down
And I love you
'Cause I love you
'Cause I love you
'Cause our love is true
When I heard your name I didn't want to stand
And I took your life by the hand
Never saw some woman like you before
Never saw some woman that showed me the door
And I love you
I love you
Now there’s all kinds of songs I heard growin' up
But I never heard one, that never seemed stuck
All kinds of songs when I was growin' up
But I never heard a song, called ‘I love you’
Love you

And I love you
And I love you
And I love
And I love you
""One more Edge""
Love
And I love

I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For,I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,U2,"I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her finger tips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for


I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still running
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found

He was my brother
I said there was no other way out of here
Be my brother
(Brother)
Got to get out, got to get out
I was walking, I was walking into walls
And back again
I just keep walking
I walk up to a window to see myself
And my reflection, when I thought about it
My direction, going nowhere, going nowhere
No-one, no-one is blinder
Than he who will not see
No-one, no-one is blinder
Than me
I was talking, I was talking in my sleep
I can't stop talk, talk, talking
I'm talking to you, it's up to you
Be my brother, there is no other way out of here

Got to get out, got to get out
Got to get out of here"

If he stops to think, he starts to cry
Oh, why?

If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow

I was on the inside

I was looking through the window
I was lost, I am found
Walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away

I see you when I go in there

See Father Christmas with a begging bowl

The whole world could just dissolve
Into a glass of water
I've been good, cause I know you don't want me to
Do you really want me to be blue as you?
It's her daylight that gets me through
We've been here before
Last time you scratched at my door
The moon was naked and cold
I was like a two-year-old
Who just wanted more

If you wear that velvet dress
If you wear that velvet dress
Tonight, the moon's drawn its curtains
It's a private show
No-one else gonna know
I'm wanting
Sunlight, sunlight fills my room
It's sharp and it's clear
But nothing at all like the moon
It's okay
The struggle for things not to say
I never listened to you anyway
And I got my own hands to pray

Tonight the moon is a mirror-ball
Light flickers from across the hall
Who'll catch the star when it falls"

In A Lifetime,In A Lifetime,U2,"Hard to tell
Or recognize a sign
To see me through
A warning sign
First the thunder Satisfied
Then the storm If the past it will not lie
Torn asunder The future, you and I
In the storm Get blown away
In a lifetime
In a lifetime
And as the rain it falls Begin again
Heavy in my heart As the storm breaks through
Believe the light in you So the light shines in you
Faded and worn Without color
Torn asunder in the storm Torn asunder in the storm
Unless the sound has faded from your soul
Unless it disappears
First the thunder Selfish storm
Then the storm Hold on the inside
Torn asunder One life
In the storm In the storm
In a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime"
In God’s Country,In God's Country,U2,"Desert sky, dream beneath the desert sky
The rivers run but soon run dry
We need new dreams tonight
Desert rose, dreamed I saw a desert rose
Dress torn in ribbons and in bows
Like a siren she calls (to me)

Sleep comes like a drug in God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses, in God's country

Set me alight, we'll punch a hole right through the night
Every day the dreamers die to see what's on the other side
She is liberty, and she comes to rescue me
Hope, faith, her vanity
The greatest gift is gold

Sleep comes like a drug in God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses, in God's country

Naked flame, she stands with a naked flame
I stand with the sons of Cain
Burned by the fire of love
Burned by the fire of love"

I'll follow you down
In the name of whiskey
In the name of song
You didn't look back
You didn't belong
In the name of reason
In the name of hope
In the name of religion
In the name of dope
In the name of freedom
You drifted away
To see the sun shining
On someone else's day
In the name of United and the bbc
In the name of Georgie Best and lsd
In the name of a father
And his wife the spirit
You said you did not
They said you did it
In the name of justice
In the name of fun
In the name of the father
In the name of the son
Call to me
No one is listening
I'm waiting to hear from you love
Stay with me
It's cold in the ground

Of the white and the black
Spilling over

I'll follow you down

I'll be home, love
When the night takes a deep breath
And the daylight has no air
If I crawl, if I come crawling home
Will you be there?

In a little while
I won't be blown by every breeze
Friday night running to Sunday on my knees
That girl, that girl she's mine
Well I've known her since
Since she was
A little girl with Spanish eyes
When I saw her first in a pram they pushed her by
Oh my, my how you've grown
Well it's been, it's been... a little while
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Slow down my beating heart

A man dreams one day to fly
A man takes a rocket ship into the skies
He lives on a star that's dying in the night
And follows in the trail, the scatter of light
Turn it on, turn it on, you turn me on

Ooh
Slow down my beating heart
Ooh
Slowly, slowly love
Slow down my beating heart
Slowly, slowly love
Slow down my beating heart
Slowly, slowly love"

In the earth the hole deep, deep, decide
If I could, I would
Up for air to swim against the tide
Hey, hey, hey
Up toward the sky
It's a blue sky

To lose along the way the spark that set the flame
To flicker and to fade on this, the longest day

So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
(So wind blow through my soul)
You give yourself to this the longest day
You give yourself, you give it all away

Two rivers run too deep, the seasons change and so do I
The light that strikes the tallest trees the light away for I
The light away
Up towards the sky
It's a blue sky

To lose along the way the spark that set the flame
To flicker and to fade on this, the longest day

So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart

Isn't that difficult
In the city you're invisible
When you come from a small town
Everything is alright

Tourist in a traffic jam
Babycham and handicam

Let's hit the main artery
No time for a tourniquet
Let the colours all run out of me

Now my heart is so full up it hurts
It's heavy as a shopping bag
Full of things I should give back
Everything is alright
Everything is alright
I'm not your baby, please
Not dizzy, just busy
Didn't drink nothing fizzy
No pills to feel easy
Don't know what got into me
Daylight a kinda robbery
The night is your geography
You're not white
You're pink and rosy
You could be right
But you're way above me
I'm in recovery
A star of pornography
I'm a tourist
There's a lot to see
You don't like the photographs of me
So, you've got a lot to say
You don't sleep around, but sometimes you stray
You don't believe
But oftentimes you pray for something
What is it babe?
Don't treat me like I'm a trick
I won't treat you like you're a prick
Don't need no doctor, I'm not sick
I'm not your baby
Everything is alright
Everything is alright
I'm not your baby"

I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart
You're nearly a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I have tried so not to give in
I have said to myself this affair
Never gonna go somewhere
But why should I try to resist
When baby I know so well
That I've got you under my skin
I would sacrafice anything
Come what might
For the sake of holding you near
In spite of a warning voice
That comes in the night
It repeats and it shouts in my ear
Don't you know blue-eyes
You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality
But each time I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'cause I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrafice anything
Come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice
That comes in the night
It repeats and it shouts in my ear
Don't you know you old fool
You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality
But each time that I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'cause I've got you under my skin
And I love you (when you're) under my skin"

Who will buy me, who will try me

You need some protection
The thinner the skin
I want you to know
That you don't need me anymore
I want you to know
You don't need anyone, anything at all

Who's to say what it is will break you
I don't know which way the wind will blow
Who's to know when the time has come around
Don't wanna see you cry
I know that this is not goodbye
In summer I can taste the salt in the sea
There's a kite blowing out of control on a breeze
I wonder what's gonna happen to you
You wonder what has happened to me
I'm a man, I'm not a child
A man who sees
The shadow behind your eyes

Who's to say where the wind will take you
Who's to say what it is will break you
I don't know where the wind will blow
Who's to know when the time has come around
I don't wanna see you cry
I know that this is not goodbye

Did I waste it?
Not so much I couldn't taste it
Life should be fragrant
Roof top to the basement
The last of the rock stars
When hip hop drove the big cars
In the time when new media
Was the big idea
That was the big idea"

And when the doorbell rings you tell me that I have a key

The road, no road without a turn and if there was
The road would be too long
What keeps us standing in this view
Is the view that we can be brand new

The landlady takes me up in the air
I go, I go where I would not dare
The landlady shows me the stars up there
I'm weightless, weightless when she is there
And I'll never know, never know what starving poets meant
'Cause when I was broke, it was you that always paid the rent

Space, her place is where I found my parking space
And when I'm losing ground, you know she gives it back to me
She whispers ""don't do, just be""

And I'll never know, never know what starving poets meant
'Cause when I was broke, it was you that always paid the rent
Every wave that broke me
Every song that wrote me
Every dawn that woke me
Was to get me home to you, see
Every soul that left me
Every heart that kept me
The strangers that protected me
To bring me back to you
Every magic potion
Every false emotion
How unswerving our devotion
To the lies we know are almost true
Every sweet confusion
Every grand illusion
I will win and call it losing
If the prize is not for you"

And maybe I said the wrong thing

Is always the last mile

And we love to fly a flag

Too right to be wrong, in this rebel song

Nothing at all, and if you can't help yourself
Well, take a look around you, when others need your time
You say it's time to go, it's your time

I'm here without a name
In the palace of my shame
I said, love, rescue me
In the cold mirror of a glass
I see my reflection pass
I see the dark shades of what I used to be
I see the purple of her eyes
The scarlet of my lies
Love, rescue me
Yeah, though I walk
In the valley of the shadow
Yet, I will fear no evil
I have cursed thy rod and staff
They no longer comfort me
Love, rescue me
Sha la la la etc
I said love, love, rescue me
Yeah, I'm here without a name
In the palace of my shame
I said love, rescue me
I've conquered my past
The future is here at last
I stand at the entrance to a new world I can see
The ruins to the right of me
Will soon have lost sight of me
Love, rescue me"
Love Will Tear Us Apart,Love Will Tear Us Apart (Ft. Arcade Fire),U2,"When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed? Our respect runs so dry
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
You cry in your sleep, all my failings exposed
I get a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
Is it something so good? I just can't function no more
But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again"

To feel so bad

I love you like mad
I love you
I love you like mad, ah

No one worth knowing has ever known a thing
No one who knew how could ever teach the world to sing
You are the only one I've ever listened to

The pain never felt so good
To feel so bad
I love you
I love you like mad
Love you

Love you like mad

Don't worry baby if you're in the spotlight
I'll do the maximum time for you tonight
You know that we're not crazy
Well maybe just a touch
Some sweet delight, a sugar rush
And some kisses cost too much

Love you

I love you like mad

Love is Bigger Than Anything in Its Way,Love is Bigger Than Anything in Its Way,U2,"The door is open to go through
If I could I would come too
But the path is made by you
As you're walking start singing and stop talking

Oh, if I could hear myself when I say
Oh, love is bigger than anything in its way

So young to be the words of your own song
I know the rage in you is strong
Write a world where we can belong
To each other and sing it like no other

Oh, if I could hear myself when I say
Oh, love is bigger than anything in its way

If the moonlight caught you crying on Killiney Bay
Oh sing your song
Let your song be sung
If you listen you can hear the silence say
When you think you're done
You've just begun
Love is bigger than anything in its way
Love is bigger than anything in its way
Love is bigger than anything in its way"

New wave airwaves swirling around my heart (uh-huh)

You no longer got a hold on me
I’m out of Lucifer’s hands
You no longer got a hold on me
You’re no longer in control of me
I am

The NME is spitting from an inky page
St. John Divine is gonna take the stage
At the talent show where your talent is your rage
I’m in

Prayers of fire on a rain dark night
Young men see visions beyond sound or sight
The Velvets beginning to see the light
Amen
You no longer got a hold on me
I’m out of Lucifer’s hands
You no longer got a hold on me
You’re no longer in control of me
I am

Yes I can change the world
Yes I can change the world
The poor breaking bread that’s made out of stone
The rich man won’t eat, he’s eating, alone
That’s easy
But I can’t change the world
In me

You no longer got a hold on me
I’m out of Lucifer’s hands
You no longer got a hold on me
You’re no longer in control of me

You're silence... searching for a sound
Your heart is aching... your heart is my home
It's fascinating... I know I'll never be alone
I'm rippin' the stitches
You got two hands to rub
I'm in the ditches
Of someone else's love
Love is when I lie
Love puts the blue back in my eye
Love will come again
I'll be gone again... again
If you're hunger... baby let me feed it
If your heart is full... baby let me bleed it
And happiness is for... those who don't really need it

I am gone again
Love's got to be with a wink
Only then love gets a chance to speak
Love will come again
I'll be gone again... again

I hear you talk
Feeling nothing
I fear nothing

I can hear so much
Fear nothing

Fear... nothing

I am gone again
Love is the end of history
The enemy of misery
Love has come again
I am gone again
Love is justice, a charity
Love brings with it a clarity
Love has come again

Spend the day there
To hear the things you haven't said
And see what you might see
I want to hear you when you call
Do you feel anything at all?
I want to see your thoughts take shape
And walk right out
Freedom has a scent
Like the top of a new born baby's head

The songs are in your eyes
I see them when you smile
I've had enough I'm not giving up
On a miracle drug
Of science and the human heart
There is no limit
There is no failure here sweetheart
Just when you quit
I am you and you are mine
Love makes nonsense of space
And time, will disappear
Love and logic keep us clear
Reason is on our side, love
The songs are in your eyes
I see them when you smile
I've had enough of romantic love
I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up
For a miracle, a miracle drug, a miracle drug

Beneath the noise
Below the din
I hear a voice
It's whispering
In science and in medicine
I was a stranger
You took me in

A time to turn your eyes away
Is there a time for keeping your head down
For getting on with your day
Is there a time for kohl and lipstick
Is there time for cutting hair
Is there a time for high street shopping
To find the right dress to wear
Here she comes, heads turn around
Here she comes, to take her crown
Is there a time to run for cover
A time for kiss and tell
A time for different colours
Different names you find hard to spell
Is there a time for first communion
A time for East 17
Is there time to turn to Mecca
Is there time to be a beauty queen
Here she comes, beauty plays the clown
Here she comes, surreal in her crown
Dici che il fiume
Trova la via al mare
E come il fiume
Giungerai a me
Oltre i confini
E le terre assetate
Dici che come il fiume
Come il fiume...

E non so più pregare
E nell'amore non so più sperare
E quell'amore non so più aspettare

Moment Of Surrender,Moment Of Surrender,U2,"I tied myself with wire
To let the horses run free
Playing with the fire
Until the fire played with me, mmm
The stone was semi-precious
We were barely conscious
Two souls too smart to be
In the realm of certainty
Even on our wedding day
We set ourselves on fire
Oh God, do not deny her
It's not if I believe in love
But if love believes in me
Oh, believe in me

At the moment of surrender
I folded to my knees
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

I've been in every black hole
At the altar of the dark star
My body's now a begging bowl
That's begging to get back, begging to get back
To my heart
To the rhythm of my soul
To the rhythm of my unconsciousness
To the rhythm that yearns
To be released from control
I was punching in the numbers
At the ATM machine
I could see in the reflection
A face staring back at me

At the moment of surrender
Of vision over visibility
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

I was speeding on the subway
Through the stations of the cross
Every eye looking every other way
Counting down 'til the pain will stop

At the moment of surrender
Of vision of over visibility
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me"

But the wind from the lough just got colder and colder
There was a badness that had it's way
Love was not lost, love will have it's day
North & south of the river
North & south of the river
Can we stop playing these old tattoos ?
Darling, I don't have the answer
I want to meet you
Where you are
I don't need you to surrender
There's no feeling
Thats so alone
As when the one you're hurting is your own
North & south of the river
North & south of the river
North & south of the river
Some high ground is not worth taking
Some connections are not worth making
There's an old church bell no longer ringing
Some old songs are not worth bringing
North (Some high ground is not worth taking)
North & south of the river"
North Star,North Star,U2,"Forty-five light years
From home
From where you are
Where I wanna be
Beside you
Looking for direction
Star to your affection
The space between you and me
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait any longer
For it
I can't wait any longer
For your love
The birds still singing for them
As they fly above the firmament
It's not a song of discontent
It's not like that
Up in the sky
Here I am, a space guy
Caught between the love and logic
Out here in the universe
Hey hey
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait any longer
For it
I can't wait any longer
For your love
And a day as it ends
And you watch as the sun goes down
Pray that the night
Will go quickly now
Your hope
Your prayer
And the clouds leave the sky alone
There's only one light that can guide you
Guide you
I can't wait any longer
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait

For your love

Of the lights up there shining
You want it
You got it
You take it like a lover inside"

A festival of brown in the city of my crush
If you walk around, you can step inside

Oh Berlin
Who could think they would find you by just looking
Oh Berlin
How many of us hide in you
Oh Berlin
To think I could know you by your name
To stare and not be stared
To look and not be seen
To feel new feelings
Rather than understand where you've just been
Fame, huh
Oh Berlin
Who could they would find you by just looking
Oh Berlin
When you flap your angel wings
Oh Berlin
To think that I could know you by your name
Chasing the ghosts of our heroes
Lou Reed, David Bowie, Iggy, Wim Wenders, Rilke
To change location rather than change yourself
To ask for directions rather than ask for help
To remain always a true friend
Oh Berlin
Who could think they would find you by just looking
Oh Berlin
When you flap your angel wings
Oh Berlin
To think that I could know you by your name
Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angelic orders
And even if one to suddenly take me to its heart
I would vanish into its stronger existence
For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror
That we are still able to bear and we revere it so
Because it calmly disdains to destroy us
Every angel is terror
Every angel is terror
Oh Berlin
Every angel is terror
Every angel is terror
Who would think they could find you by just looking
Every angel is terror

Will it make it easier on you, now

You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

Wants to find us again

It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time leaves us polished stones

We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and I
We'll build our house in the trees
Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put there with a magic marker
For years I would believe
That the world couldn't wash it away
'Cause we can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Are we tough enough
For ordinary love

We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher

Out of Control,Out of Control,U2,"Monday morning
Eighteen years dawning
I said how long
Say how long
It was one dull morning
I woke the world with bawling
I was so sad
They were so glad

I had the feeling it was out of control
I was of the opinion it was out of control
Boys and girls to school
And girls they make children
Not like this one

I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control
I fought fate
There's blood at the garden gate
The man said childhood
It's in his childhood
One day I'll die
The choice will not be mine
Will it be too late?
You can't fight fate

I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control"
Paint It Black,Paint It Black,U2,"I see a red door
And I want to paint it black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back
I see them turn their heads
Cruelly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens every day

I look inside myself
See my heart is back
I see my red door
And I wanna paint it black
Maybe then I'll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up
When your whole world is black
No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee
This thing happening to you
If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me
Before the morning comes

I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as coal
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as coal
I wanna see it painted
Painted black

I wanna see it painted
Painted black

I know he does all that he can, wham bam
And she won't tell me his name

I thought the world revolved around me
I was wrong
But you can sing, sing along
And if you dance
Then dance with me
I know a girl

Peace on Earth,Peace on Earth,U2,"Heaven on Earth
We need it now
I'm sick of all of this
Hanging around
Sick of sorrow
Sick of the pain
Sick of hearing again and again
That there's gonna be
Peace on Earth

Where I grew up
There weren't many trees
Where there was we'd tear them down
And use them on our enemies
They say that what you mock
Will surely overtake you
And you become a monster
So the monster will not break you

It's already gone too far
Who said that if you go in hard
You won't get hurt
Jesus can you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line
Peace on Earth
Tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground
Peace on Earth
No whos or whys
No-one cries like a mother cries
For peace on Earth
She never got to say goodbye
To see the colour in his eyes
Now he's in the dirt
Peace on Earth

They're reading names out over the radio
All the folks, the rest of us, won't get to know
Sean and Julia, Gareth, Ann and Breda
Their lives are bigger than any big idea

Jesus can you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line
Peace on Earth
To tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground
Peace on Earth
Jesusin  the song you wrote
The words are sticking in my throat
Peace on Earth
Hear it every Christmas time
But hope and history won't rhyme
So what's it worth?
This peace on Earth
Peace on Earth
Peace on Earth
Peace on Earth"
Please,Please,U2,"So you never knew love
Until you crossed the line of grace
And you never felt wanted
Till you'd someone slap your face
So you never felt alive
Until you'd almost wasted away

You had to win, you couldn't just pass
The smartest ass at the top of the class
Your flying colours, your family tree
And all your lessons in history

Please, please, please
Get up off your knees
Please, please, please, please, oh yeah

And you never knew how low you'd stoop
To make that call
And you never knew what was on the ground
Till they made you crawl
So you never knew that the heaven
You keep you stole
Your Catholic blues, your convent shoes
Your stick-on tattoos now they're making the news
Your holy war, your northern star
Your sermon on the mount from the boot of your car

Please, please, please
Get up off your knees
Please, please, please
Leave me out of this, please

So love is hard
And love is tough
But love is not
What you're thinking of

September, streets capsizing
Spilling over down the drains
Shard of glass, splinters like rain
But you could only feel your own pain
October, talk getting nowhere
November, December; remember
We just started again
Please, please, please
Get up off your knees, yeah
Please, please, please, please, ah

So love is big
Is bigger than us
But love is not
What you're thinking of
It's what lovers deal
It's what lovers steal
You know I've found it
Hard to receive
Cause you, my love
I could never believe"

To the higher ground
And I, like a firework, explode
Roman candle, lightning, lights up the sky
In cracked streets, trample underfoot
Side-step, sidewalk
I see you stare into space
Have I got closer now, behind the face?
Oh, tell me, sharing a dance with me
Turn me around tonight
Up through the spiral staircase to the higher ground

5:30 on a Friday night, 33 good people cut down

Set fire to the sky

Golden hills, golden memories
I follow the ocean wherever it goes

We've got a thousand points of light for the homeless man
We've got a kinder, gentler machine gun hand
We got department stores and toilet paper
Got Styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people, says, keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

Running to Stand Still,Running to Stand Still,U2,"And so she woke up
Woke up from where she was lyin' still
Said I gotta do something
About where we're going
Step on a steam train
Step out of the driving rain, maybe
Run from the darkness in the night
Singing ah, ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day

Sweet the sin
Bitter the taste in my mouth
I see seven towers
But I only see one way out
You gotta cry without weeping, talk without speaking
Scream without raising your voice
You know I took the poison from the poison stream
Then I floated out of here, singing
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day

She runs through the streets
With her eyes painted red
Under a black belly of cloud in the rain
In through a doorway
She brings me white golden pearls
Stolen from the sea
She is ragin', she is raging
And the storm blows up in her eyes
She will suffer the needle chill
She's running to stand still"

She’s A Mystery To Me,She's A Mystery To Me,U2,"Darkness falls and she
Will take me by the hand
Take me to some twilight land
Where all but love is gray
And I need find my way
Without her as my guide
Night comes, I'm fast beneath her spell
Daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn, and burn eternally?
She's a mystery to me
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She... is a mystery girl
In the night of love
Words tangled in her hair
Words soon to disappear
A love so sharp it cut
Like a switchblade to my heart
Words tearing me apart
Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn, and burn eternally?

You were always wishing and aching
So ever, always firezone

Seeks your only zone

Praying hands hold me down
If only the hunter was hunted
In this tin can town, tin can town
No stars in the black night
Looks like the sky fall down
No sun in the daylight
Looks like it's chained to the ground, chained to the ground

The warden says ""The exit's sold.""
If you want a way out...
Silver and gold, silver and gold

Broken back to the ceiling
Broken nose to the floor
I scream at the silence
It's crawling, crawls under the door
There's a rope around my neck
And there's a trigger in your gun
Jesus, say something!
I am someone, I am someone

Captains and Kings in the ship's hold
They came to collect
Silver and gold, silver and gold
I seen the coming and the going
Seen the captains and the Kings
Seen their navy blue uniforms
Seen them bright and shiny things, bright and shiny things

The temperature is rising
The fever white hot
Mister I ain't got nothing
But it's more than you've got
These chains no longer bind me
Nor the shackles at my feet
Outside are the prisoners
Inside the free (set them free)

A prize fighter in a corner is told
Hit where it hurts - For Silver and Gold
You can stop the world from turning around
You just gotta pay a penny in the pound"

Slow Dancing,Slow Dancing (Ft. Willie Nelson),U2,"My love is cruel as the night
She steals the sun and shuts out the light
All of my colors, they turn to blue
Win or lose

She does it slow dancing
Slow dancing
She does it slow
Dancing, all night long

Scarlet eyes and see-through heart
She saw me coming right from the start
She picked me up, but had me down on my knees
Just a-begging her, begging her please

Take me slow dancing
Slow dancing
She took me slow
Dancing, all night long

And I don't know why a man
Search for himself in his lover's eyes
No, I don't know why a man
Sees the truth but needs the lies
My love is restless as the wind
She moves like a shadow across my skin
She left with my conscience, I don't want it back
It just gets in the way

If you wanna go slow dancing
Slow dancing
She took me slow
Dancing, all night long

Slow dancing

Decaying I'm praying
You are my abbot

And love can't be your song

I'm breaking it taking it
I'm breaking it slowly in mind
I'm seeing it freeing it
I know love is in this soul of mine
It's not in your eyes
I don't want
I don't want to see you smile
I started light-hearted
It won't be easy like you said
I'm going flowing
I'm leaving on the day of the dead
I will never get, you will never get
I don't want to see you smile
God knows it, knows it
Knows it, knows it
You sing
Hear me love
Sing it again
Going out blind
The smoke machine is yours not mine
I don't want to see you smile
I will live again
You will live again
I just don't want to see you smile"

It doesn't matter to you, it matters to me
We're cut adrift, but still floating
I'm only hanging on to watch you go down, my love
I disappeared in you
You disappeared from me
I gave you everything you ever wanted
It wasn't what you wanted
The men who love you, you hate the most
They pass right through you like a ghost
They look for you, but your spirit is in the air
Baby, you're nowhere

Oh, love, you say in love there are no rules
Oh, love, sweetheart, you're so cruel

Desperation is a tender trap
It gets you every time
You put your lips to her lips
To stop the lie
Her skin is pale like God's only dove
Screams like an angel for your love
Then she makes you watch her from above
And you need her like a drug
Oh, love, you say in love there are no rules
Oh, love, sweetheart, you're so cruel

She wears my love like a see-through dress
Her lips say one thing, her movements something else
Oh, love, like a screaming flower
Love dying every hour
Ah, you don't know if it's fear or desire
Danger the drug that takes you higher?
Head of heaven, fingers in the mire
Her heart is racing you can't keep up
The night is bleeding like a cut
Between the horses of love and lust we are trampled underfoot

Oh, love, you say in love there are no rules
Oh, love, sweetheart, you're so cruel"

Some days come clean, other days are sneaky

Some days you're quick, but most days you're speedy
Some days you use more force than is necessary
Some days just drop in on us
Some days are better than others

Some days it all adds up
And what you've got is enough
Some days are better than others

Some days are slippy, other days are sloppy;
Some days you can't stand the sight of a puppy
Your skin is white, but you think you're a brother
Some days are better than others
Some days you wake up with her complaining
Some sunny days you wish it was raining
Some days are sulky, some days have a grin;
And some days have bouncers and won't let you in

Some days you hear a voice
Taking you to another place
Some days are better than others
Some days are honest, some days are not;
Some days you're thankful for what you've got
Some days you wake up in the army
And some days it's the enemy
Some days are work, most days you're lazy
Some days you feel like a bit of a baby
Lookin' for Jesus and his mother
Some days are better than others

Some days you feel ahead
You're making sense of what she said
Some days are better than others
Some days I hear a voice
Taking you to another place
Some days are better than others"

You're the reason why the opera is in me

Well, hey now
Still I've got to let you know
A house doesn't make a home
Don't leave me here alone

This is a city that a...a lot of Irish people came to this city, right? So this time...this Irish...the Irish people came as rock and roll band, okay? So...but this is a folk song. It's like...the Irish kinda' hold America in a very special place because, for over a hundred years or more, Irish have come over here to find work and find a future. And they brought with them songs, old Irish folk songs that became old American folk songs. And, I hope maybe we'd leave behind some songs one day. This is a song written by Peggy Seeger. It's a song...I wished I'd heard this song on the radio during the miners' strike in England a few years ago. This is called Springhill Mining Disaster

C'mon ye people
Stand up for your love
I gotta stand up to ego but my ego's not really the enemy
It's like a small child crossing an eight-lane highway
On a voyage of discovery
Stand up to rock stars, Napoleon is in high heels
Josephine, be careful of small men with big ideas

Whooo hooo hoo
Whooo hooo hoo
Out from under your beds
C'mon ye people
Stand up for your love
God is love
And love is evolution's very best day
Soul rockin' people moving on
Soul rockin' people on and on
C'mon ye people
We're made of stars
C'mon ye people
Stand up then sit down for your love"

You stop in for a pack of cigarettes
You don't smoke, don't even want to
I see you check your change
Dressed up like a car crash
The wheels are turning byt you're upside down
You say when he hits you, you don't mind
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive
Is that what it is?
Red lights, grey morning
You stumble out of a hole in the ground
A vampire or a victim
It depend's on who's around
You used to stay in to watch the adverts
You could lip synch to the talk shows
And if you look, you look through me
And if you talk it's not to me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing
If I could stay... then the night would give you up
Stay, and the day would keep it's trust
Stay, and the night would be enough
Faraway, so close
Up with the static and the radio
With satelite television
You can go anywhere
Miami, New Orleans, London, Belfast and Berlin
And if you listen I can't call
And if you jump, you just might fall
And if you shout I'll only hear you
If I could stay... then the night would give you up
Stay then the day would keep it's trust
Stay with the demons you drowned
Stay with the spirit I found
Stay and the night would be enough
Three o'clock in the morning
It's quiet and there's no one around
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel runs to ground
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel hits the ground"

The country’s already starving
So we sacrifice many to shed light on all of them

Lost her uncles, and then
And then buried with no caskets
They just put covers on them
And the tears fall, and we fight back
The story can’t end, no not like that

You who inspired us
To rebuild this country, you just guide us

Not just to pray

His smiling face I can't forget
He looked at me across the street
But that's a long way here
Oh, and I wish you were here

I watched as he watched us get back on the bus
I watched the way it was
The way it was when he was with us
And I really don't mind sleeping on the floor

We have one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love

We're freezing
We're leaving
Believing
That all we need is to head over somewhere
In a summer
To come
So we run

We have one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love

Oh and when all is lost
When all is lost we find out what remains
Oh the same oceans crossed
For some it’s pleasure, for some it’s pain

In the rubble of Aleppo
Flowers blooming in the shadows
For a summer of love

Wipe your tears away

I rolled up my sleeves for to buckle her shoe

And wherever he goes, we'll be wishing him well

The unheard, the unseen, the unwashed, and the clean where the streets all have names
Baggot Street, meets the street right on St. Stephen's Street lovers and loners who can peer on your shoulders
The gods and the rapers, immigrants and traders, sing about him
A man for a man and a hand for a hand
Trust in the music, strike up the band
The more that we sing, the less that we find
Time and again, this is brood to be right
Build you a statue on St. Stephen's Green
No fairer monument there to be seen
A statue of Ronnie Drew, holding the hand
Of a girl with her hair in a black velvet band
(Hey! Hey!)
Here's to you (No stranger to dare), Ronnie Drew (Or angels to devil)
Here's to you (A friend of a friend of a friend of a), Ronnie Drew (A friend to you)
Ronnie Drew (Ronnie Drew), we love you, yes we do
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you

The first kiss and the first dance
All of us are wondering why we’re here
In the crystal ballroom underneath the chandelier
Wet the glass ’til the glasses sing
We punish our hearts ’til the heart bells ring
Cause where we come from
We’re not always kind
The human story is what love leaves behind
We’re the ghosts of love
And we haunt this place
We’re the ghosts of love
In every face
In the ballroom of the crystalline
Everyone’s here with me tonight
Everyone but you
Our first chance is their last dance
Our life is shaped by another’s hands
Buttoning, unbuttoning a Coco dress
Stopping and not stopping every cold caress
Born for bliss, born for this
Every human life begins with a kiss
A kiss by every kind of possibility
And everyone is here tonight with me
We’re the ghosts of love
And we haunt this place

I have a brother, when I'm a brother in need
I spend my whole time running
He spends his running after me
I feel myself goin' down
I just call and he comes around
But for the first time I feel love
My father is a rich man, he wears a rich man's cloak
He gave me the keys to his kingdom (coming)
Gave me a cup of gold
He said ""I have many mansions
And there are many rooms to see.""
But I left by the back door
And I threw away the key
And I threw away the key
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, I feel love"

A clown slipping backwards
You laugh at another's shame

I know I'm limping low down
I don't mind

It's all just a game
And I'm going down
And I'm strolling down

Living I'm limping more

Out of the living world
Out of time

To rout around
And around, and around
To round round

There's a cloud

So...it's waiting there for you and me
Just a fool, a street jester
The hero of society
Just a fool, a street jester

A life in emotion
A world I'm glad I didn't see
A cartoon in motion
A key to the same day
I don't mind, I'm here to know
I wanna go go go go go

How she made us feel
How she made me real
And the ground beneath her feet
And the ground beneath her feet

And now I can't be sure of anything
Black is white, and cold is heat
For what I worshipped stole my love away
It was the ground beneath her feet
It was the ground beneath her feet
Go lightly down your darkened way
Go lightly underground
I'll be down there in another day
I won't rest until you're found
Let me love you true, let me rescue you
Let me lead you to where two roads meet
O come back above
Where there's only love
And the ground beneath her feet
And the ground beneath her feet"
The Hands That Built America,The Hands That Built America,U2,"Oh my love
It’s a long way we’ve come
From the freckled hills to the steel and glass canyons
From the stony fields, to hanging steel from the sky
From digging in our pockets, for a reason not to say goodbye
These are the hands that built America
Russian, Sioux, Dutch, Hindu
Polish, Irish, German, Italian
I last saw your face in a watercolour sky
As sea birds argued a long goodbye
I took your kiss on the spray of the new line star
You gotta live with your dreams
Don’t make them so hard
And these are the hands that built America
These are the hands that built America
The Irish, the Blacks, the Chinese, the Jews
Korean, Hispanic, Muslim, Indian
Of all of the promises
Is this one we can keep?
Of all of the dreams
Is this one still out of reach?
Its early fall
There’s a cloud on the New York skyline
Innocence dragged across a yellow line
These are the hands that built America
These are the hands that built America"
The Little Things That Give You Away,The Little Things That Give You Away,U2,"The night gave you a song
A light had been turned on
You walked out in the world
Like you belong there
As easy as a breeze
Each heart was yours to please
Is it only me who sees
There’s something wrong there

Oh la la, I’m not a ghost now
I can see you
You need to see me

It’s the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way

I saw you on the stairs
You didn’t notice I was there
That’s ‘cause you were talking at me
And not to me
You were high above the storm
A hurricane being born
This freedom it might cost you
Your liberty

It’s the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way
It’s the little things that tease and betray
Has the hunter now become the prey?
It’s the little things
The little things that give you away

Sometimes
I can’t believe my existence
See myself from a distance
I can’t get back inside
Sometimes
The air is so anxious
All my thoughts are so reckless
And all my innocence has died
Sometimes
I wake at four in the morning
Where all the darkness is swarming
And it covers me in fear
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
I'm full of anger and grieving
So far away from believing
That any sun will reappear
Sometimes
The end is not coming
It’s not coming
The end is here
Sometimes

Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
When the painted glass shatters
And you’re the only thing matters
But I can’t see you through the tears
Sometimes
The end is not coming
It’s not coming
The end is here
Sometimes"

The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone),The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone),U2,"I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere near
Your voice was all I heard
I was shaking from a storm in me
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see
Yeah, I wanted to be the melody
Above the noise, above the hurt

I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

We got language so we can't communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
And give it a name
I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

We can hear you (hear you)
We can hear you
We can hear you (hear you, ooh)

I woke up at the moment when the miracle had come
I get so many things I don't deserve
All the stolen voices will some day be returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

Your voices will be heard
Your voices will be heard"

Michael Jackson, history
If beauty is truth
And surgery the fountain of youth
What am I to do?
Have I got the gifts to get me through
The gates of that mansion?
If O.J. is more than a drink
And a Big Mac bigger than you think
And perfume is an obsession
And talk shows confession
What have we got to lose?
Another push and we'll be through
The gates of that mansion
I never bought a lotto ticket
I never parked in anyone's space
The banks they're like cathedrals
I guess casinos took their place
Love, come on down
Don't wake her she'll come around
Chance is a kind of religion
Where you're damned for plain hard luck
I never did see that movie
I never did read that book
Love, come on down
Let my numbers come around
Don't know if I can hold on
Don't know if I'm that strong
Don't know if I can wait that long
Till the colours come flashing
And the lights go on
Then will there be no time for sorrow
Then will there be no time for shame
Though I can't say why
I know I've got to believe
We'll go driving in that pool
It's who you know that gets you through
The gates of the playboy mansion
Then will there be no time for sorrow
Then will there be no time for shame
Then will there be now time for shame
Then will there be now time for pain"

Walk till you run and don't look back
For here I am
Carnival, the wheels fly and the colours spin through alcohol
Red wine that punctures the skin
Face to face in a dry and waterless place
Walk on by, walk on through
So sad to besiege your love so head-on
Stay this time, stay tonight in a lie
I'm only asking, but I, I think you know
Come on take me away, come on take me away
Come on take me home, home again
And if the mountains should crumble
Or disappear into the sea
Not a tear, no not I

Of a city without a soul
I went out walking under an atomic sky
Where the ground won't turn and the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye
Yeah, I went with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering
I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in
I stopped outside a church house
Where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it
I went out riding down that old eight-lane
I passed by a thousand signs looking for my own name
I went with nothing but the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you
I went out there in search of experience
To taste and to touch and to feel as much
As a man can before he repents
I went out searching, looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who would sit at his father's right hand
I went out walking with a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up, Jesus I'll be home soon
Yeah, I went out for the papers, told her I'd be back by noon
Yeah, I left with nothing but the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you
Yeah, I left with nothing, nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering"

We knew the world would never be the same
Soldier this is where you can reach me now
On a double decker bus
Into College Square
If you won’t let us in your world
Your world just isn’t there
Old man says that we never listen
We shout about what we don’t know
We’re taking the path of most resistance
The only way for us to go
Hup, 2, 3, 4, was enough

Soldier soldier
We signed our lives away
Complete surrender
The only weapon we know
Soldier soldier
We knew the world will never be the same
Soldier this is where you can reach me now

This is the site
This is the season
This is where you can reach me now
This is the time
This is the number
This is where you can reach me now"

He took an open top beetle through the eye of a needle
He was tryin' to throw his arms around the world
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you, woman be still
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you, woman, I will
Nothing much to say, I guess; just the same as all the rest

I ache in the places where I used to play
And Im crazy for love but Im not coming on
Im just paying my rent every day
Oh in the tower of song
I said to hank williams: how lonely does it get?
Hank williams hasnt answered yet
But I hear him coughing all night long
A hundred floors above me
In the tower of song
I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty-seven angels from the great beyond
They tied me to this table right here
In the tower of song
So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
Im very sorry, baby, doesnt look like me at all
Im standing by the window where the light is strong
Ah they dont let a woman kill you
Not in the tower of song
Now you can say that Ive grown bitter but of this you may be sure
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And theres a mighty judgement coming, but I may be wrong
You see, you hear these funny voices
In the tower of song
I see you standing on the other side
I dont know how the river got so wide
I loved you baby, way back when
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
Well never have to lose it again
Now I bid you farewell, I dont know when Ill be back
There moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But youll be hearing from me baby, long after Im gone
Ill be speaking to you sweetly
From a window in the tower of song
Yeah my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And Im crazy for love but Im not coming on
Im just paying my rent every day

I feel you in my arms
I'll take you in my hand
I'll let you go
Somebody save me

Sing it

Smile
Though your heart breaks in two
Touch me

You think I'm no good
Well I know I've been bad
Took you to a place
Now you, can't get back
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
Walk together
Down a dead end street
We were mixing the bitter
With the sweet
Don't try to figure out
What we might have had
Just two shots of happy, one shot of sad
I'm just a singer
Some say a sinner
Rollin' the dice
Not always a winner
You say I've been lucky
Well hell!, I made my own
Not part of the crowd
But not feeling alone
Under pressure
But not bent out of shape
Surrounded
We always found an escape
Drove me to drink
But hey, thats not all bad
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
Guess I've been greedy
All of my life
Greedy with my children
My lovers, my wife
Greedy for the good things
As well as the bad
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
Maybe it's just talk
Saloon singing
The chairs are all stacked
The swingers stopped swinging
You say I hurt you
You put the finger on yourself
Then after you did it
You came crying for my help
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
I'm not complaining
Baby, I'm glad
You call it compromise
Well whats that ?

One shot
Of sad"

We were as close together as a bride and groom
We ate the food, we drank the wine
Everybody having a good time except you
You were talking about the end of the world

I took the money, I spiked your drink
You miss too much these days if you stop to think
You led me on with those innocent eyes
And you know I love the element of surprise
In the garden I was playing the tart
I kissed your lips and broke your heart
You, you were acting like it was the end of the world

In my dream, I was drowning sorrows
But my sorrows they'd learned to swim
Surrounding me, going down on me
Spilling over the brim
Waves of regret and waves of joy
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy
You, you said you'd wait till the end of the world

To be rent from one so dear
We fought for justice and not for gain
But the magistrate sent me away
Now kings will rule and the poor will toil
And tear their hands as they tear the soil
But a day will come in this dawning age
When an honest man sees an honest wage
Hold me now, oh hold me now

Listen to the reed in the saxophone
Listen over the hum of the radio
Listen over the sound of blades in rotation
Listen through the traffic and circulation
Listen as hope and peace try to rhyme
Listen over marching bands playing out their time

Did you think to try and warn her?
Were you working on something new?

Is it like a tape recorder?
Can we rewind it just once more?"

What you've got they can't deny it
Can't sell it, or buy it
Walk on, walk on
Stay safe tonight

And I know it aches
And your heart it breaks
And you can only take so much
Walk on, walk on

Home, hard to know what it is if you've never had one
Home, I can't say where it is but I know I'm going home
That's where the heart is

And I know it aches
And your heart it breaks
And you can only take so much
Walk on, walk on

Leave it behind
You've got to leave it behind
All that you fashion
All that you make
All that you build
All that you break
All that you measure
All that you steal
All this you can leave behind
All that you reason
All that you care
It's only time
And I'll never fill up all my mind
All that you sense
All that you speak
All you dress up
And all that you scheme
All you create
All that you wreck
All that you hate"
Walk to the Water,Walk to the Water,U2,"She said it wasn't cold
She left her coat unbuttoned
She wore canvas shoes
White canvas shoes
Around her neck
She wore a silver necklace
'It was given to me by my father' she said
'It was given to me'
She took the back way home
Past the lights at Summerhill
Turn left on to the north strand
And on
On towards the sea
He said he was an artist
But he really painted billboards
In large capital letters
In large capital letters
He was telling jokes
Nobody else would listen to him
I saw you that day
Your lips were cherry red
Your legs were crossed your arms wide open
Your hair was coloured gold
And like a field of corn
You were blown by the wind
You were blown by the wind
Walk, walk, walk to the water
Walk with me awhile
Walk, walk, walk to the roadside
Walk with me in a light
A room in the Royal hotel
With sea facing views
A man with a suitcase
Full of things he doesn't need
I'm looking through your window
I'm walking through your doorway
I'm on the outside
Let me in
Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me
Walk, walk, walk to the water
Walk with me
Walk, walk, walk to the roadside
Walk with me a while"
Wave Of Sorrow,Wave Of Sorrow,U2,"Heat haze rising

To bring your children
To give them away

Is daylight never done
Cruelty just begun
To make a shadow of everyone
And if the rain came

Blankets on burning trees
I am sick without disease
Nobility on it's knees

Where the ancient holy scrolls?
Where now Emperor Menelek?

And on your finger precious stones
As every good thing now been sold
Son, of shepherd boy, now king
What wisdom can you bring?
What lyric would you sing?
Where is the music of the Seraphim?

And if the rain came... now
Would it wash us all away
On a wave of sorrow

A wave of sorrow

Blessed are the meek who scratch in the dirt
For they shall inherit what's left of the earth
Blessed are the kings who've left their thrones
They are buried in this valley of dry bones
Blessed all of you with an empty heart
For you got nothing from which you cannot part
Blessed is the ego
It's all we got this hour
Blessed is the voice that speaks truth to power
Blessed is the sex worker who sold her body tonight
She used what she got
To save her children's life
Blessed are you, the deaf cannot hear a scream
Blessed are the stupid who can dream
Blessed are the tin canned cardboard slums
Blessed is the spirit that overcomes"

When I Look at the World,When I Look at the World,U2,"When you look at the world
What is it that you see?
People find all kinds of things
That bring them to their knees
I see an expression
So clear and so true
That it changes the atmosphere
When you walk into the room

So I try to be like you
Try to feel it like you do
But without you it's no use
I can't see what you see
When I look at the world

When the night is someone else's
And you're trying to get some sleep
When your thoughts are too expensive
To ever want to keep
When there's all kinds of chaos
And everyone is walking lame
You don't even blink now, do you
Or even look away
So I try to be like you
Try to feel it like you do
But without you it's no use
I can't see what you see
When I look at the world

I can't wait any longer
I can't wait till I'm stronger
Can't wait any longer
To see what you see
When I look at the world

I'm in the waiting room
I can't see for the smoke
I think of you and your holy book
While the rest of us choke

Tell me, tell me, what do you see?
Tell me, tell me, what's wrong with me"
When Love Comes to Town,When Love Comes to Town (Ft. B.B. King),U2,"I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
I was under the waves before love rescued me
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
Now I stand accused of the things I've said
When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town
Used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town
I ran into a juke-joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue, I was dazed and in a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town
When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town
When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town
I was there when they crucified my Lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide
When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town
(Lost lyrical stanza)
When I woke up I was sleeping on the street
I felt the world was dancing, and I was dirt beneath their feet
When I woke up I saw the Devil looking down
But my Lord He played guitar the day love came to town"
Where Did It All Go Wrong,Where Did It All Go Wrong,U2,"Did you get it
Did you need it
Did you really
What you wanted
Was it good in the sun
Did you really have the fun
Did you crack it
Did you grab it
Did you reel it
Like a rabbit
Did you rock
Did you roll
Did you move yourself along
And how could you do
And did you see me sing this song
Where did it all go wrong
Where did it all go wrong
Did you grab it
Did you want it
Is it really what you wanted
Did you run in the sun
Did you imitate a walk
Did you answer
Did you grab it
Did you gun it like a rabbit
Did you walk
Did you run
Can you feel you rising up
And how can you do
And when you sang it in the song
And it sank, and it threw
Where did it all go wrong
Did you drown it
Did you roll it
Did you smash it
Did you warm it
Did you clean it
Clean it up
Did you rub it
Did you soap
Did you screen it
Did you ream it
Did you ruin it
Did you feed it
Is it warm in the sun
When the weather's getting warm
And the worlds at your feet
And it is our time to say
It's all gone wrong
Where did it all go wrong

Where the Streets Have No Name,Where the Streets Have No Name,U2,"I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls
That hold me inside
I wanna reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name

I wanna feel sunlight on my face
I see the dust-cloud
Disappear without a trace
I wanna take shelter
From the poison rain
Where the streets have no name

Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do

The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do

Our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh and I see love
See our love turn to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do"
Whiskey In The Jar,Whiskey In The Jar,U2,"As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said stand and deliver or the devil he may take ya
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she'd love me, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman for you know she treat me easy
Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' my money with me and I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels
Now some men like the fishin' and some men like the fowlin'
And some men like ta hear a cannon ball a roarin'
Me I like sleepin' specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain yeah"
White As Snow,White As Snow,U2,"Where I came from there were no hills at all
The land was flat, the highway straight and wide
My brother and I would drive for hours
Like we had years instead of days
Our faces as pale as the dirty snow
Once I knew there was a love divine
Then came a time I thought it knew me not
Who can forgive forgiveness where forgiveness is not?
Only the lamb as white as snow
And the water, it was icy
As it washed over me
And the moon shone above me
Now this dry ground, it bears no fruit at all
Only poppies laugh under the crescent moon
The road refuses strangers
The land the seeds we sow
Where might we find the lamb as white as snow
As boys we would go hunting in the wood
To sleep the night shooting out the stars
Now the wolves are every passing stranger
Every face we cannot know
If only a heart could be as white as snow
If only a heart could be as white as snow"

Who’s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses,Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses,U2,"You're dangerous 'cos you're honest
You're dangerous 'cos you don't know what you want

For any spirit to haunt

You're a piece of glass left there on the beach
Well you tell me things I know you're not supposed to
Then you leave me just out of reach

Hey hey, sha la la

Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea
Who's gonna ride your wild horses

Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee

The deeper I spin
The hunter will sin for your ivory skin
Took a drive in the dirty rain
To a place where the wind calls your name
Under the trees, the river laughing at you and me
Hallelujah, heaven's white rose
The doors you open, I just can't close
Don't turn around
Don't turn around again
Don't turn around
Your gypsy heart
Don't turn around
Don't turn around again
Don't turn around
And don't look back
Come on now love
Don't you look back

Who's gonna drown in your blue sea
Who's gonna taste your salt water kisses
Who's gonna take the place of me
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who could tame the heart of thee"
Wild Honey,Wild Honey,U2,"In the days
When we were swinging from the trees
I was a monkey
Stealing honey from a swarm of bees
I could taste
I could taste you even then
And I would chase you down the wind

You could go there if you please
Wild honey
And if you go there, go with me
Wild honey

Did I know you?
Did I know you even then?
Before the clocks kept time
Before the world was made
From the cruel sun
You were shelter
You were my shelter and my shade

If you go there with me
Wild honey
You can do just what you please
Wild honey
Yeah, just blowing in the breeze
Wild honey
Wild, wild, wild
I'm still standing, I'm still standing
Where you left me
Are you still growing wild
With everything tame around you?
I send you flowers
Cut flowers for your hall
I know your garden's full
But is there sweetness at all?

Oh oh oh
What is soul?
Love me
Give me soul

If you go there, go with me
Wild honey
Won't you take me, take me please?
Wild honey
Yeah, swinging through the trees
Wild honey

Wild Irish Rose,Wild Irish Rose,U2,"In a field by a river
My love and I did lie
And on my naked shoulder
She too proud to cry
She said that I must leave her
An icy tear she froze
How could I melt the heart
Of a wild irish rose
Well a gypsy she has made of me
A servent of the street
And back to bed I've travelled
To taste a love as sweet
Well the heart it knows no reasons
And reason never knows
As I lie with them I'm thinking
Of a wild irish rose
Well I saw the city of angels
It brought a devil out in me
And hell's hotel on sunset
Showed a whore no mercy
As the orange sky was screaming
From the roof I let her go
These are the dizzying heights that brought me
My wild irish rose
Now red is the rose
That she layed on my grave
A life is what she wanted
And a life I surely gave
Like a hundred men before me
They lay lying here in rows
Young men, bloody
As a wild irish rose"
Wild Rover,Wild Rover,U2,"I've been a wild rover for many's the year
I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
And I never will play the wild rover no more
And it's No, Nay, never
No, nay never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more
I went in to an alehouse I used to frequent
And I told the landlady me money was spent
I asked her for credit, she answered me nay
Such a customer as you I can have any day
And it's No, Nay, never
No, nay never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more
I took up from my pocket, ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
She says ""I have whiskeys and wines of the best
And the words that you told me were only in jest""
And it's No, Nay, never
No, nay never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And, when they've caressed me as oft times before
I never will play the wild rover no more
And it's No, Nay, never
No, nay never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more"
Window in the Skies,Window in the Skies,U2,"The shackles are undone

Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
What it's done to me?
Love makes strange enemies
Makes love where love may please
The soul and its striptease
Hate brought to its knees
The sky over our head
We can reach it from our bed
You let me in your heart
And out of my head, head

For every heart that cries
Love left a window in the skies
And to love I rhapsodize"

And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on sit in judgment of all wrong
They decide and the shotgun sings the song
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play, just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
The change, it had to come, we knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold, that's all
And the world looks just the same and history ain't changed
'Cause the banners, they are flown in the last war
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play, just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again, no no
I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
Though I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do ya?
There's nothing in the streets, looks any different to me
And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
And the parting on the left is now parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around

All I want is to get right next to you
All I want is your picture in a locket
Your face in my pocket
Take a pill to stop it

Xanex and wine

Check the stocks, I’m in detox
Want a lot of what you got

All I want is a picture of you
All I want is to get right next to you
All I want is your picture in a locket
Your face in my pocket
Take a pill to stop it
Take me, save me from myself
I know that you’ve been good to me
Now I need you not to be
Wake me, I fear I can’t be asleep
Try not to look so bored
You’re buying things you cannot afford
I got your drive, I know you want my
Xanex and wine
Don’t you worry ‘bout your mind
Seems I worry all the time
Don’t you worry, you’ll be fine
You should worry ‘bout the day
That the pain, it goes away
You know, I miss mine sometimes
There is no fiction
That will truly fit this situation
I’m documenting every detail
Every conversation
Not used to talking to somebody in the body
Somebody in a body
It’s somebody in a body
In a body there’s somebody
Somebody in a body
Somebody, somebody, somebody
It’s somebody in a body
Somebody in a body
Somebody in a body there’s somebody"
Yahweh,Yahweh,U2,"Take these shoes
Click clacking down some dead end street
Take these shoes
And make them fit
Take this shirt
Polyester white trash made in nowhere
Take this shirt
And make it clean, clean
Take this soul
Stranded in some skin and bones
Take this soul
And make it sing

Yahweh, Yahweh
Always pain before a child is born
Yahweh, Yahweh
Still I'm waiting for the dawn

Take these hands
Teach them what to carry
Take these hands
Don't make a fist, no
Take this mouth
So quick to criticize
Take this mouth
Give it a kiss
Yahweh, Yahweh
Always pain before a child is born
Yahweh, Yahweh
Still, I'm waiting for the dawn
Still waiting for the dawn
The sun is coming up

The sun is coming up on the ocean
This love is like a drop in the ocean
This love is like a drop in the ocean
Oh

Yahweh, Yahweh
Always pain before a child is born
Yahweh, tell me now
Why the dark before the dawn?
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh

Take this city
A city should be shining on a hill
Take this city
If it be your will
What no man can own
No man can take
Take this heart
Take this heart
Take this heart
And make it break"
Yellow,Yellow,U2,"Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called ""Yellow""
Your skin
Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn it into something beautiful
D'you know
You know I love you so
You know I love you so
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do"
Your Blue Room,Your Blue Room,U2,"It's time to go again
To your blue room
Got some questions to ask of you
In your blue room
The air is clean
Your skin is clear
I've had enough of
Hanging round here
It's a different kind of conversation
In your blue room
Saw me coming
In and outside
Saw me coming
Somewhere to hide
And time is a string of pearls
Your blue room
Once again
See the future just hanging there
Your blue room
A new frame
A new perspective
Looking down on my objectives
Your instructions
Whatever their directions
Your blue room
Saw me coming
East by the moon
Saw me coming
Can you feel
(It's allright)
Your blue room
One day I'll be back
Your blue room
Yeah, I hope I remember where it's at
Your blue room
We see me slide down
Won't you give me a home
So much for change
Zooming in
Zooming out
Nothing I can't do without
A lense to it all up close
To Magnify what no one knows
Never in company
Never alone
No car alarm
No cellular phone"
You’re the Best Thing About Me,You’re the Best Thing About Me,U2,"When you look so good, the pain in your face doesn't show
When you look so good and baby, you don't even know
When the world is ours but the world is not your kind of thing
Full of shooting stars, brighter as they're vanishing
Oh you've seen enough to know it's children who teach
You're still free enough to wake up on a bed or a beach

You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me
The best thing about me

I been crying out, ""How bad can a good time be?""
Shooting off my mouth, that's another great thing about me
I have everything but I feel like nothing at all
There's no risky thing for a man who's determined to fall

You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me
Why am I
Why am I walking away?
Walking away
Why am I walking away?

I can see it all so clearly
I can see what you can't see
I can see you love her loudly
When she needs you quietly

You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me

Why am I
Why am I walking away?
Walking away
Why am I walking away?"
Zoo Station,Zoo Station,U2,"I'm ready
Ready for the laughing gas
I'm ready
Ready for what's next
Ready to duck
Ready to dive
Ready to say
I'm glad to be alive
I'm ready
Ready for the push

In the cool of the night
In the warmth of the breeze
I'll be crawling around
On my hands and knees

She's just down the line ... Zoo Station
Got to make it on time ... Zoo Station

I'm ready
Ready for the gridlock
I'm ready
To take it to the street
Ready for the shuffle
Ready for the deal
Ready to let go
Of the steering wheel
I'm ready
Ready for the crush
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
It's alright ... it's alright ... it's alright ... it's alright
Hey baby ... hey baby ... hey baby ... hey baby ...
It's alright
It's alright

Time is a train
Makes the future the past
Leaves you standing in the station
Your face pressed up against the glass

I'm just down the line from your love ... Zoo Station
Under the sign of your love ... Zoo Station
I'm gonna be there ... Zoo Station
Tracing the line ... Zoo Station
I'm gonna make it on time ... make it on time ... Zoo Station
Just two stops down the line ... Zoo Station
Just a stop down the line ... Zoo Station"
Zooropa,Zooropa,U2,"What do you want?
What do you want?

Zooropa: Vorsprung durch Technik
Zooropa: be all that you can be
Be a winner
Eat to get slimmer

Zooropa: a bluer kind of white
Zooropa: it could be yours tonight
We're mild and green
And squeaky clean

What do you want?
What do you want?

Zooropa: better by design
Zooropa: fly the friendly skies
Through appliance of science
We've got that ring of confidence
And I have no compass
And I have no map
And I have no reasons
No reasons to get back
And I have no religion
And I don't know what's what
And I don't know the limit
The limit of what we've got

(Zooropa)
Don't worry baby, it'll be alright
(Zooropa)
You got the right shoes
(Zooropa)
To get you through the night
(Zooropa)
It's cold outside, but brightly lit
(Zooropa)
Skip the subway
(Zooropa)
Let's go to the overground
Get your head out of the mud baby
Put flowers in the mud baby
Overground
No particular place names
No particular song
I've been hiding
What am I hiding from?

(Zooropa)
Don't worry baby, it's gonna be alright
(Zooropa)
Uncertainty can be a guiding light
(Zooropa)
I hear voices, ridiculous voices
(Zooropa)
In the slipstream
(Zooropa)
Let's go, let's go overground
(Zooropa)
Take your head out of the mud baby

She's gonna dream up
The world she wants to live in
She's gonna dream out loud
She's gonna dream out loud
Dream out loud"
